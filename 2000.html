                    <em>April 21, 1999</em></p>
                <p><em>JEFFERSON COUNTY &mdash;</em> Two students, cloaked in black trench coats and armed with guns and bombs, opened fire Tuesday at Columbine High School, killing as many as 25 people and wounding at least 22 others in the worst school shooting in U.S. history.</p>
                <p>Police found the two suspects shot to death in the library.</p>
                <p>The masked shooters first targeted specific victims, especially ethnic minorities and athletes, then randomly sprayed school hallways about 11:30 a.m. with bullets and shotgun blasts, witnesses said. The bloody rampage spanned four hours.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I saw them shoot a girl because she was praying to God,&rdquo; said Evan Todd, 15, a sophomore. &ldquo;They shot a black kid. They called him a nigger. They said they didn&rsquo;t like niggers, so they shot him in the face.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>School hallways were booby-trapped with at least 12 bombs, some on timers, which still were exploding at 10:45 p.m. One suspect&rsquo;s coat was laced with explosive devices, and undetonated pipe bombs were planted around bodies, police said.</p>
                <p>Students described the shooters as part of an outcast group of a dozen or so suburban high school boys known as the Trench Coat Mafia who often wore dark trench coats and had German slogans and swastikas on their clothes. The suspects were identified as Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17.</p>
                <p>The murders came on the 110th anniversary of Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s birth.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard numbers as high as 25 deaths,&rdquo;  said Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone, adding that 17 were confirmed. &ldquo;When we did make entry into the library, it was a pretty gruesome scene.&rdquo; He called the murders a &ldquo;suicide mission.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Byron Kirkland saw the massacre begin: &ldquo;There was a girl crouched beneath a desk in the library, and the guy came over and said, &lsquo;Peekaboo,&rsquo; and shot her in the neck,&rdquo; said Kirkland, a 15-year-old sophomore. &ldquo;They were hooting and hollering and getting big joy out of this.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Aaron Cohn, 15, a sophomore, said he was ducking beneath a table when he suddenly felt a gun barrel pressed to his head. A gunman said: &ldquo; &lsquo;All the jocks stand up. We are going to kill you,&rsquo; &rdquo; Cohn said.</p>
                <p>Bree Pasquale, a junior, said: &ldquo;You could hear them laughing as they ran down the hallways shooting people. He put a gun in my face and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m doing this because people made fun of me last year.&rsquo; &ldquo; She escaped unshot but splattered with a fellow student&rsquo;s blood.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Brittany Bollerud, 16, hid under a library table and saw only the gunmen&rsquo;s shoes and long trench coats. &ldquo;They yelled, &lsquo;This is revenge,&rsquo;  &rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They asked people if they were jocks. If they were wearing a sports hat, they would shoot them.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I saw (a teacher) on the floor bleeding from everywhere. He was trying to direct kids, but he couldn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; said Rachel Erbert, a 17-year-old senior. &ldquo;It was really scary. Kids were falling, and you&rsquo;d help them up. I thought I might get shot.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>By 3:45 p.m., shots still rang out inside the school. While more than 200 law enforcement officers and four SWAT teams tried to stop the gunmen and evacuate wounded high school students, paramedics frantically treated victims in makeshift triage units on the front lawns of houses outside the suburban Jefferson County school.</p>
                <p>At one point, a bloody boy dangled down from a second-floor window and was caught by two SWATteam members. Another person held up a sign in a classroom window: &ldquo;Help, I&rsquo;m bleeding to death.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;There are some who were killed as they were hiding under desks,&rdquo; said an officer who was inside the school. &ldquo;Some looked like they were trying to crawl away. They were executed &mdash; shot in the head.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>With news of the murders being broadcast locally and nationally on live television, Columbine High School looked like a war zone. Medical helicopters landed on nearby athletic fields, then whisked the wounded to six local hospitals. More than 2,000 people across metro Denver waited in line to donate blood.</p>
                <p>Panicked parents rushed to the school for news about their children. Some talked to their trapped children on cell phones.</p>
                <p>At 6:25 p.m., Jefferson County District Attorney Dave Thomas told parents gathered inside Leawood Elementary School that at least 10 bodies could not be removed immediately from the high school because there were bombs near the bodies.</p>
                <p>Parents were told to bring their children&rsquo;s dental records. Some parents vomited.</p>
                <p>Search warrants were executed Tuesday night at the suspects&rsquo; homes, the district attorney said. The sheriff said the gunmen used at least one automatic assault rifle and several shotguns in the attack.</p>
                <p>At 8 p.m., Michael Shoels was still awaiting word on his son, Isaiah, an 18-year-old senior. Shoels feared his son was targeted because he was black.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;This late, it&rsquo;s not looking good at all,&rdquo; Shoels said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a dream I&rsquo;m trying to wake up from. &hellip; I just wish everybody would pray for my family.&rdquo; Shoels&rsquo; two other children also attend Columbine, and they were safe.</p>
                <p>The shootings were the latest in a series of school shootings since 1997 that have shocked the nation and led to calls for tighter security and closer monitoring of troubled students. Two people were killed at a school in Pearl, Miss., three at West Paducah, Ky., five at Jonesboro, Ark., and two at a school in Springfield, Ore.</p>
                <p>President Clinton opened a news conference Tuesday by calling for prayers for the students, teachers and staff at Columbine. The murders came as Gov. Bill Owens and the Colorado Legislature have tried to pass a bill to liberalize the state&rsquo;s concealed-weapons laws.</p>
                <p>Jenni LaPlante, 18, said one of the suspected shooters was calm Tuesday morning at a beforeschool bowling class. She said the student was extremely smart.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He knew all the answers. If we were reading Shakespeare, he would know the hidden meaning,&rdquo; LaPlante said.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen them lash out at anyone,&rdquo; LaPlante said. &ldquo;But I would say, &ldquo;Why do you guys wear all that German stuff? Are you Nazis?&rsquo; And they would say, &lsquo;Yeah, Heil Hitler.&rsquo; &ldquo; LaPlante said she never knew whether the suspects were joking.</p>
                <p>One shooter was in Michele Fox&rsquo;s creative-writing class.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;They hate our school. They hate everything about it,&rdquo; said Fox, 18, a senior. &ldquo;In our class, we have to read out loud and stuff, and they would always write about death. They wore black trench coats with combat boots and their pants tucked into them.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Ben Grams, a junior, called the Trench Coat Mafia group &ldquo;a bunch of unwanted kids who were teased and pushed around a lot.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Another student said the group talked often in class about beheading people, and many often sang and quoted songs by shock-rocker Marilyn Manson. Some also wore bands that read, &ldquo;I hate people.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Students said the bloodshed began when two students &mdash; dressed in black trench coats and masks that were taken on and off &mdash; hurled at least one bomb onto the school roof during the A-track lunch hour. Another bomb was stashed in a backpack and left by the front door.</p>
                <p>John Cook, 16, a sophomore, was eating lunch outside with friends when the violence started.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;These guys opened fire on every thing that looked human,&rdquo; Cook said. &ldquo;They were shooting at some kids down below, then they pointed at us and started shooting. Bullets were bouncing everywhere. Two guys next to me got hit.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>As the gunmen hustled into the school and through the hallways, panic spread. Casey Fisher, 15, was buying his lunch in the cafeteria with a friend. &ldquo;My friend came out and he was standing 10 feet from the guy, and they shot him and he fell to the ground,&rdquo; Fisher said.</p>
                <p>Karen Nielson, a cafeteria worker, said, &ldquo;I tried to help the others, but he just kept firing.&rdquo; Some witnesses reported hearing as many as 15 bomb blasts. At one point, a bomb exploded and hurt several students, including one girl later hospitalized with eight shards in her chest. &ldquo;I was running for my life,&rdquo; said Crystal Enney, 18, a senior.</p>
                <p>Smoke spread, and the fire alarm blared. In the chaos, some students sprinted to safety. Others were gunned down in the hall. A few tried locking themselves in bathrooms.</p>
                <p>In Katie Crona&rsquo;s freshman earthsciences class, students dived under their desks. In the next classroom, students could hear windows being blasted out by gunmen. A few students escaped and told how others had been shot. &ldquo;We sat there in a circle for four hours. We were huddled together. It was terrifying,&rdquo; Crona said. The students heard someone tugging at their classroom doorknob, but it was locked. The gunmen continued on.</p>
                <p>The worst carnage was in the library, where the gunmen terrorized 45 fellow students with bullets &mdash; and maniacal laughs.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;They were going around asking people why they should let them live,&rdquo; said Todd, the 15-year-old sophomore. &ldquo;Once when they shot a black kid, one of them said, &ldquo;Oh my God, look at this black kid&rsquo;s brain! Awesome, man!&rsquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;They came up to me, pointed a gun at my head and asked if I was a jock. I said no. Basically I lied. They said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s revenge time on jocks for making us outcasts.&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
                <p>Jonathan Vandermark, 16, a sophomore, said he passed three bodies in a stairwell as he and other students were rescued from the biology lab by a SWAT team. Shards of glass were everywhere, he said.</p>
                <p>Vandermark was about 20 feet away from one of the shooters when gunfire broke out. He described the weapons as being like Uzis. Other witnesses recalled a sawed-off shotgun and at least one handgun. &ldquo;A teacher who tried to help us was shot in the arm,&rdquo; said Vandermark, who hid in the biology lab.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Scott Cornwell, father of senior Matt Cornwell, received a cell-phone call from his trapped son, who was barricaded in the choir room with 40 other students.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He was whispering. He said, &lsquo;Dad, we&rsquo;re inside. There are 40 of us. What&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
                <p>The father took his cell phone to a police commander, who told them, &ldquo;Get away from the door!&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Police said they found the two suspects shot to death in the library. Several bombs were found in one suspect&rsquo;s house, and police later uncovered two cars parked outside the school that had been booby-trapped with bombs.</p>
                <p>Today the Colorado Legislature had been scheduled to debate a bill to liberalize the state&rsquo;s concealedweapons laws, but all legislative work was canceled because of the shootings.</p>
                <p>Gov. Owens, who supports liberalized concealed-weapons laws, comforted families at the crime scene with his wife, Frances, but refused to comment on the gun legislation.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not immune from the problems you see in other parts of the country,&rdquo; Owens said. &ldquo;Perhaps our innocence is lost today.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Some Columbine students said some warnings about trouble from the Trench Coat Mafia were scrawled as graffiti on bathroom walls. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d go in there and it would have &lsquo;Columbine will explode some day,&rsquo; or &lsquo;All jocks must die,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Kill all athletes,&rsquo; &rdquo; said Doug Mohr, a senior football player. &ldquo;There&rsquo;d be pictures of guns and swastikas.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Jefferson County School District administrators said they didn&rsquo;t know about any racist or threatening graffiti. &ldquo;I visited the students there and it appeared to be a creating environment, where students feel safe,&rdquo; said schools superintendent Jane Hammond. &ldquo;We were not aware of the Trench Coat Mafia until today.&rdquo; A photo in last year&rsquo;s yearbook listed one group as the &ldquo;Trenchcoat Mafia.&rdquo; School principal Frank DeAngelis could not be reached for comment.</p>
                <p>Some students said the tragedy could have been worse had it not been a &ldquo;senior skip day.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The day is known in circles as &ldquo;4-20&rdquo; &mdash; when students around the country skipped school to smoke marijuana. Aside from it having been April 20, the police code for a drug bust in Los Angeles is also 4-20.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;This is the big day for (smoking marijuana),&rdquo; said Columbine student Jason Greer, 16.</p>
                <p>Many students were aware of the day&rsquo;s significance, and many chose not to attend school Tuesday.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe something like this would happen at Columbine,&rdquo; said Joyce Oglesbee, mother of senior Tara Oglesbee. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a topclass school, preppy and perfect. We haven&rsquo;t even had a senior prank.&rdquo;</p>

                <h3 class="subheading">Panic yields to relief for lucky</h3>
                <p class="byline">By Bruce Finley and David Olinger, The Denver Post<br />
                <em>April 21, 1999</em></p>
                <p>Fanned out across the Denver metro area at work and in their cars, they heard the first sketchy rumors.</p>
                <p>Trouble at Columbine.</p>
                <p>Gunshots.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, existence boiled down to what matters most. And strange kids in trenchcoats were threatening to yank it away.</p>
                <p>The result was the most intense moments that some 4,000 Colorado parents have ever known. They screamed. Cried. Hyperventilated. Prayed. One woman ran through the streets in her stockings.</p>
                <p>For most, the worst that it got was not knowing.</p>
                <p>For some, the pain will be infinite. As many as two dozen kids are gone.</p>
                <p>And just about all of these parents were struggling Tuesday night&mdash;with counterparts across America&mdash;about whether to ever let their children go again.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;You think school is a safe place to send your kids,&rdquo; said Victor Anderson, father of 17-year-old Brian Anderson, who was treated and released from Lutheran Hospital after one of the gunman shot him in the chest.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;It was supposed to be a place where they learned and had fun,&rdquo; Anderson said.</p>
                <p>Shortly before noon, the rumors were starting to fly.</p>
                <p>A phone call from a daughter-in-law to her tech center office reached Debbie Jones. Kids in trenchcoats taking hostage at the high school. Students falling, bleeding.</p>
                <p>Please she thought as she ran for the television in the office, don&rsquo;t let my daughter have been shot.</p>
                <p>Co-workers gathered around her, trying to comfort her. She sunk into thoughts that the girl she raised&mdash;16-year-old Jessica&mdash;could be lost. &ldquo;My only one. She&rdquo;s a teenager. But she&rsquo;s a good kid. Very joyful to be around. An excellent sense of humor. She makes me laugh.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Helpless, Debbie Jones prayed. She wanted to leave. She told herself not to. She trusted and trusted that her girl Jessica would call if she could.</p>
                <p>And Jessica came through in the end, calling safe and sound from the Columbine Public Library.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I just knew she would,&rdquo; Debbie said later. &ldquo;She was crying.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Some were driven to frenzied action.</p>
                <p>Mary Beth Beck, who lives right behind the high school football fields, couldn&rsquo;t find her son for 90 minutes after the shootings began. She got in her car, encountered a police blockade.</p>
                <p>She got out of the car and just ran, in her stockings, tearing them open on the asphalt. And didn&rsquo;t care about anything until she found 14-year-old Michael safe at Leawood Elementary.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Oh God,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was crying, bawling my head off.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>All afternoon, parents fought their way through traffic to Leawood, where dozens of Columbine students sat on a stage waiting to go home. On a wall at the entrance to the school, names were posted of students known to be safe at a nearby public library. Inside, parents gazed anxiously at other lists, writing down names of student still believed to be missing.</p>
                <p>Many parents stood outside the school crying, straining to see as busloads of kids from Columbine pulled up to Leawood.</p>
                <p>With each busload, there were shouts and tears of recognition, while other parents walked away in disappointment.</p>
                <p>Some couldn&rsquo;t handle the uncertainty.</p>
                <p>Julie Jorgensen hyperventilated for 15 minutes&mdash;fearing her Katie was gone. She breathed into a paper bag.</p>
                <p>The best early information went to the people with connections. People like Cynthia Partridge, principal of Leawood, just a few blocks from Columbine.</p>
                <p>She received telephone calls straight from police. An officer told her that some students were being held hostage.</p>
                <p>Partridge tried to hide her concern. Her own three sons were Columbine students.</p>
                <p>She hurled herself into locking down Leawood to protect the 565 children there.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We completely locked up, pulled down all the curtains, shades, and blinds, and put paper over all the windows so no one could see in,&rdquo; Partridge said. &ldquo;We had children eat in their classrooms instead of the cafeteria.</p>
                <p>She wouldn&rsquo;t know for hours that her own boys were safe.</p>
                <p>Debbie Icke, a middle school secretary whose two sons Luke, 19, and Matt, 15, attended Columbine High, heard first about the trouble from Luke.</p>
                <p>He called her at work, saying somebody was shooting in the school. He told her he was safe, away from the school at a friend&rsquo;s house.</p>
                <p>Then Luke said he couldn&rsquo;t find his brother.</p>
                <p>Tears welling, Debbie ordered Luke to stay. Luke said no. Again she implored. Again he insisted. And he went.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I had to find my brother,&rdquo; Luke explained.</p>
                <p>And she had to find her son.</p>
                <p>They met up on the crazy streets outside the school, where students were running, jumping fences. Neither had found Matt. They looked together.</p>
                <p>Finally they found him in the crowd&mdash;45 tortuous minutes later. And Luke said he learned something new from how his mother was crying.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;How much they care,&rdquo; is how he described it later at home. &ldquo;You know that they care. But you don&rsquo;t really get to see that expression on their face. Scared. Lost. I know that they care about me.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Relief came in bursts, and shrieks&mdash;knowing at last.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Please God, Please God, let him be okay.&rdquo; Luann Ingels was saying as she paced near the school. Then the cell phone rang.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Hello Zach? You at home. You safe? &hellip; Oh thank you, God!&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Terrified as she waited, Jane Savage eyed the other parents nervously in the Columbine public library.</p>
                <p>Then a car pulled up, and out came John, her son.</p>
                <p>She saw him there. And she screamed.</p>
                <p>Then she looked around again at the anxious faces of others. Her terror relieved, she lurched into trying to comfort the others who didn&rsquo;t yet know.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I hope things turn out for you,&rdquo; she told them.</p>
                <p>The victims hadn&rsquo;t been identified Tuesday evening.</p>
                <p>And most of their parents were too grief-stricken to speak.</p>
                <p>Those who were fortunate now worry that their children will be deeply scarred.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very sensitive,&rdquo; Debbie Jones said of her daughter.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that this is really going to affect her a lot. Emotionally. I think she&rsquo;s going to have problems accepting that this actually happened at her school.&rdquo;</p>

                <em>April 21, 1999</em></p>
                
                <p>It was a scene of chaos, pieced together through the shaky voices of teenagers, some splattered with the blood of their friends, some wondering how it was they managed to get out alive, some too upset even to cry.</p>
                
                <h4>Bartholomew Foster, 15, a freshman</h4>
                
                <p>&ldquo;I was in the cafeteria &hellip; a teacher ran in and said, &lsquo;Get down!&rsquo; After a little while, we saw smoke outside the windows to the student lot &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
                <p>People got up off the floor and ran upstairs. They heard shooting. Foster ran into the first classroom he saw, a science classroom.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;There were about six kids and one teacher in there hiding. The teacher locked the door and put a table up against it.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Foster came in the other door to the classroom, crawling across the floor to stay out of the line of fire. Bullets shot through the window in one of the doors and &ldquo;wood and glass were flying across the room.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We were in there for three or four hours &hellip; You could hear a huge explosion, like bombs going off and there was yelling outside the doors of the classroom.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;One of shooter guys was yelling, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a sh--. They were really close. I wanted to leave. I wanted the SWAT team to come in there. We were cramped in a little corner.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;After about 45 minutes, we started to calm down. We went through the door to next classroom. There were about 20 students in there and we were all talking about how we didn&rsquo;t believe it had happened. Girls were crying and there was a lot of screaming everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
                <h3>Adam Foss, 18, a senior:</h3>
                <p>&ldquo;I was in the choir room and somebody came in and said, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a gun!&rsquo; There were about 60 kids in there. About half left in a panic and half stayed there.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I stuck my head out the door and I saw a gun barrel. I saw a teacher say &lsquo;Get down!&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Then I saw the gun shoot, smoke came out of the barrel. A teacher fell into the lockers. I saw the teacher get shot and he was still trying to get the kids out of the hallway.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;As we go out, we see the legs of people and backpacks everywhere. When we walked outside, we stepped over two bodies.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The cafeteria was flooded with water because the sprinklers went off. There were powder marks from guns on the walls, the doors were kicked in.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We saw one kid lying on the stairs, and one was on the ground. They were just dead, purple, their eyes still open.&rdquo;</p>
                <h3>Wade Frank, a senior:</h3>
                <p>He was out in the parking lot standing talking to a friend when he noticed one of the shooters in a black trench coat at the top of stairs. The shooter aimed and shot a girl in the leg. She was lying on a curb and a young man came to her rescue.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;The trench coat walked up and shot the boy point blank in the back.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The guy in the trench coat then walked up a small incline and threw a hand grenade into a parking lot.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He was just totally calm about everything.&rdquo;</p>
                <h3>Nick Foss, 18, a senior:</h3>
                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it in my life. I&rsquo;ve never seen so many dead people. We walked out of the cafeteria and saw more bodies. One kid had his face blown off. And I saw one of my friends with his face shot off.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Kids were trying to crawl out through the vents. They were looking for a place to hide, a way to get to safety.</p>
                <p>He was in the cafeteria with his friends when the shooting started.</p>
                <h3>Denny Rowe, 15, a sophomore:</h3>
                <p>He was outside, having lunch with friends.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;These guys opened fire on everything that looked human.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Two gunmen were on top of the stairs at the entrance of the school.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;They were shooting at some kids down below then they pointed at us and started shooting. Bullets were bouncing everywhere. Two guys next to me got hit.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>One of the injured was Mike Johnson, 16, a sophomore, who was shot in the leg.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He was running and screaming.&rdquo;</p>
                <h3>Araceli Gaucin, 16, junior:</h3>
                <p>Running through the hallway &ldquo;l just saw a bunch of people on the ground lying down in pools of blood.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>She and her friend Michelle heard gunshots and ran into the kitchen of the cafeteria.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We were waiting for (the cops) to get them and they never got them.&rdquo;</p>
                <h3>Melanie Poleschook, a sophomore:</h3>
                <p>She was in science class on the second floor of the school when she heard gunshots. The students tried to leave but everyone moved them back into the room and for the next three hours she lay on the floor of that classroom watching a wounded business teacher, Mr. (Dave) Sanders.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He lost a lot of blood &hellip; his pulse was so slow. He was really cold.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Students tried to help him as much as they could, but for the entire three hours, they were afraid he was going to die.</p>
                <h3>Brian Ftepp, 16, sophomore:</h3>
                <p>He was walking across the soccer field when he heard shots. He turned around.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;One guy was wearing a black trench coat. He turned to a girl that was walking near him and he shot her eight times.&rdquo;</p>
                <h3>Pat Neville, 15, a sophomore:</h3>
                <p>He was walking toward his car to go to lunch, when he heard what he thought were firecrackers. Then he saw a guy throw a black thing, possibly a hand grenade or a pipe bomb, on top of the school and it exploded into fire. Another gunman was outside the building, carrying an assault rifle.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I thought, Oh my God, it&rsquo;s not a prank.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I never ran so fast in my life. There was smoke all over the place.&rdquo;</p>
                <h3>Jennifer Pierce, 17, a junior:</h3>
                <p>&ldquo;We all thought it was a joke, but then the teacher came in and said, &lsquo;Get out now!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We ran out of the school, across the street and then we heard gunshots again.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The students ran into neighborhood, knocking on doors, but many of the people in the neighborhood refused to let them in their homes out of fear for their own lives.</p>

I was like, &lsquo;Do I really want to take the bus to work every day for $10 an hour and live in a crappy apartment?&rsquo; I was going to end up in jail or doing drugs. So instead of going to work one day, I just took the bus to the recruiting station.&rdquo; Scott said he was not aware of the looming war in Iraq when he signed up. &ldquo;I was 18 years old.

			<p>Shouts of delight turned quickly to tears in the newsroom of The Denver Post on Monday as staffers learned from a live webcast that they had won the Pulitzer Prize for breaking news coverage of the Columbine High School tragedy.</p>
            <p>The prize is regarded as the most prestigious award in journalism.</p>
            <p>The Denver Rocky Mountain News also won a Pulitzer, for photography of the Columbine story.</p>
            <p>Employees at both papers said it was one of the most painful stories in their careers. On April 20, 1999, two students killed 12 of their peers and a teacher and wounded dozens of others before killing themselves in the worst school shooting in U.S. history.</p>
            <p>Longtime Post reporter Pete Chronis, who contributed to the Columbine stories, said the underlying tragedy takes the pleasure out of the award.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The whole Denver metro area got stabbed in the heart when this happened,&rdquo; Chronis said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the type of thing you get over very easily. The parents haven&rsquo;t, and they never will.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>&ldquo;While it is rewarding to be recognized by your peers, our hearts go out to the Columbine victims and their families for their incomprehensible losses,&rdquo; said Frank Scandale, assistant managing editor of news, who was the metro editor at the time of the shooting.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We achieved what we did because we did it together. And because we all cared deeply,&rdquo; Scandale said.</p>
            <p>Pulitzer judges reward journalism that provides a community service, said Denver Post Editor Glenn Guzzo, who also worked on the Pulitzer Prize-winning staffs of the Akron Beacon Journal, the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The judges are looking for something that makes a difference,&rdquo; Guzzo said, adding that Monday&rsquo;s announcement is &ldquo;validation that what we&rsquo;ve been doing all along has real value of community service.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The Post staff will donate the $5,000 award that accompanies the prize to the HOPE fund for the construction of a new Columbine High School library. In addition, Post publisher Gerald E. Grilly announced that the company would match the $5,000 award.</p>
            <p>Community reaction to the local Pulitzers will be mixed, predicted Sally Blanchard, Jefferson County Public School District area administrator whose schools include Columbine.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Truthfully? A lot of it is dependent upon how this first anniversary is portrayed,&rdquo; Blanchard said. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s definite concern about retraumatizing people that we have heard all year long from mental-health experts. The sounds of helicopters down here bother people a lot.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>At the time of the shootings, Blanchard was principal of Chatfield High School, where Columbine students finished their school year last year. She said she was too busy to read the stories in local newspapers or watch TV coverage but said that staff members and parents had a range of opinions on the sensitivity of the coverage.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Everyone just kind of felt overwhelmed,&rdquo; she said.</p>
            <p>Craig Michalik, stepfather of Richard Castaldo, who was paralyzed in the attack, said his family has been treated fairly by the media even though others haven&rsquo;t had the same experience.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we have anything negative to say at all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every day somebody calls us. Three times a day. But if you tell people you&rsquo;re not interested, they&rsquo;ve respected that.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>William Dean Singleton, vice chairman, president and CEO of MediaNews Group Inc., The Denver Post&rsquo;s parent company, choked back tears as he lauded the team effort for the prize in the newsroom Monday. The award is a first for MediaNews but the fifth time The Post has won in its history.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;As proud as I was today about the Pulitzer, I was just as proud during the times I was reading the papers,&rdquo; Singleton said later. He said he first experienced the total impact of Columbine several days after the shootings occurred that Tuesday morning.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I went to the news meeting Thursday and saw 16 or 17 editors sitting around the room planning the next day&rsquo;s paper and did not see a dry eye,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Fifty-year-old guys, people I&rsquo;ve known in the newsroom ever since I&rsquo;ve been here, breaking down in tears.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>Singleton added that he was proud of the News for winning its Pulitzer despite the heated competition between the two papers.</p>
            <p>The Denver Post has won Pulitzers four other times: Paul Conrad and Patrick Oliphant won for editorial cartoons in 1964 and 1967, respectively; Anthony Suau for photography in 1984; and the Denver Post staff for public service in 1986.</p>
            <p>John Temple, editor of the Denver Rocky Mountain News, said the two awards validated his belief that Denver is home to solid, national-caliber journalism.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I called Glenn (Guzzo) today and congratulated him and asked him to pass on my congratulations,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all journalists. I&rsquo;m proud to say we&rsquo;re living in a city where judges thought the best in the country was right here.&rdquo; But winning the Pulitzer &mdash; the paper&rsquo;s first &mdash; created mixed reaction for staffers there, too.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to win awards for stories like this,&rdquo; said the News&rsquo; director of photography, Janet Reeves. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not exactly highfiving each other. We&rsquo;re very proud of the work that we did, but our hearts and thoughts still go out to the community.&rdquo; </p>
            <p>News photographer Ken Papaleo said the funerals of the slain were the most difficult assignments he&rsquo;s ever been given.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You were hoping that they didn&rsquo;t want you to come in because you knew what it would be like,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But they let us in, and I&rsquo;ll tell you, a lot of us ended up putting our cameras on auto focus. We were crying.&rdquo;</p>

                   <p>After serving four years as a reconnaissance man and deploying twice to Iraq, Brian Scott Ostrom returned home to the U.S. with a severe case of post-traumatic stress disorder. &ldquo;The most important part of my life already happened. The most devastating. The chance to come home in a box. Nothing is ever going to compare to what I&rsquo;ve done, so I&rsquo;m struggling to be at peace with that,&rdquo; Scott said.</p>

        <p>He attributes his PTSD to his second deployment to Iraq, where he served seven months in Fallujah with the 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion. </p>
        <p>&ldquo;It was the most brutal time of my life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize it because I was living it. It was a part of me.&rdquo;</p>
        <p> Since his discharge, Scott has struggled with daily life, from finding and keeping employment to maintaining healthy relationships. But most of all, he&rsquo;s struggled to overcome his brutal and haunting memories of Iraq. Nearly five years later, Scott remains conflicted by the war. Though he is proud of his service and cares greatly for his fellow Marines, he still carries guilt for things he did &mdash; and didn&rsquo;t do &mdash; fighting a war he no longer believes in.</p>

The stitches in his neck were from his attempted suicide earlier in the week after the couple had an argument. &ldquo;It spiraled out of control. &hellip; I was so full of rage and resentment. I was mad at myself. I was in flight-or-fight mode. Since I&rsquo;m a Marine, there is no flight mode. It&rsquo;s fight &hellip; it&rsquo;s kill, kill, kill. Well, I&rsquo;m not going to kill (her),&rdquo; he said. Scott said he believes every combat vet struggling with PTSD has a contingency plan. &ldquo;Every one of us has a suicide plan. We all know how to kill, and we all have a plan to kill ourselves.&rdquo; </p>

So, I grabbed a nice kitchen knife and cut my wrists,&rdquo; Scott said.</p>

The hike was led by Veterans Expeditions, which aims to help struggling veterans adjust to being home, and to balance their lives. Scott said later he appreciated his conversation with Himber, who is a Vietnam veteran. They talked about a friend of Scott&rsquo;s who was killed in Iraq. Scott often thinks about the &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; he served with. &ldquo;I miss quite a few of those guys. They were all good guys, and there is no replacement for them. &hellip; What you share with those people is stronger than most all the other bonds. One thing that&rsquo;s great about having been a Marine is I&rsquo;ve got friends wherever I go.&rdquo;</p>

I handle it like a Marine, like it&rsquo;s a combat situation,&rdquo; Scott said. &ldquo;Being diagnosed with PTSD is an interesting thing. &hellip; It means I have nightmares every night. It means I&rsquo;m hyper-vigilant &mdash; means I&rsquo;m weird about noises in the middle of the night and lock my doors. It means I have no fuse and if I get attacked, I&rsquo;m going to kill. &hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to feel this way.&rdquo;</p>

It always is.&rdquo; He decided to go for a walk and take photos. Photography was part of his training as a reconnaissance man in the Marines and, upon his return, it became a hobby. He passed by an older vet wearing a Marine cap. Scott said, &ldquo;You see the older veterans. They just look at you, but you know what they&rsquo;re thinking.

It&rsquo;s not, though.&rdquo; He tossed the papers across the table.

I control who visits me. I have room here. I feel like I&rsquo;m getting a fresh start. I don&rsquo;t hear a thing. This is peace and quiet. This is what I need.&rdquo; Scott said his life before Iraq was normal. &ldquo;I was so different. I was a normal high school kid. Then I joined the Marines. &hellip; I learned a lot of lessons really fast. &hellip; But when I got out, I let all that go. I adapted to my new environment. I let my hair grow. I started smoking pot. I adapted. I was adapting well, but now I feel like the black sheep.&rdquo;</p>

My parents were proud of me.&rdquo; He talked about why he signed up. &ldquo;I had just totaled my truck. … I was like, &lsquo;Do I really want to take the bus to work every day for $10 an hour and live in a crappy apartment?&rsquo; I was going to end up in jail or doing drugs. So instead of going to work one day, I just took the bus to the recruiting station.&rdquo; Scott said he was not aware of the looming war in Iraq when he signed up. &ldquo;I was 18 years old.

Scott said consistent physical training was missing from his life, and that as a Marine, that consistency and training is important. &ldquo;Marines need pain and physical activity to be happy people &mdash; you&rsquo;ve got to punish your body in order to survive.&rdquo;</p>
