He stood in formation.

Instead of facing off with the enemy they were being asked to provide transportation, react to events long after the fact and undertake mundane chores.

                <p class="byline"></p>
				<p>Craig F. Walker was a photojournalist for <em>The Denver Post</em> from 1998-2015.</p>
				<p>After growing up in York, Pennsylvania, Walker attended the Rhode Island School of Photography, graduating in 1986. He worked for <em>Marlboro Enterprise</em> and the <em>Berkshire Eagle</em> prior to taking a position with <em>The Denver Post</em> in 1998.</p> 
				<p>Craig F. Walker has covered some of the most important reverberations of the terror attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., fixing a compassionate lens on the men, women and children tangled then, and now, in the continuing story of geopolitical conflict.</p>
                <p>He chronicled the aftermath of the collapse of the World Trade Center towers in New York, the war in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002, the installation of Hamid Karzai as head of Afghanistan&rsquo;s provisional government in 2001, and the deployment of American troops in Kuwait in 2003, and in Iraq in 2005 and 2009.</p>

			<p>The soldier, Ian Fisher, and his family were quietly ushered into the newsroom to share in the moment &mdash; they had been sneaked into the building to preserve the surprise by Post editors who were tipped about the award in advance &mdash; and reporters and editors from across the newsroom soon converged on the photo department applauding.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the announcement, Walker wore an expression of dumbfounded joy.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What am I supposed to say?&rdquo; he wondered aloud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m speechless.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The people who deserve the real thanks are standing right here,&rdquo; he said, gesturing to Fisher and his family. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to thank them for sharing over two years of their lives.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ecstatic for him,&rdquo; Fisher said.</p>
            <p>The award, the most prestigious in American journalism, is the sixth Pulitzer for The Post and the first since 2000, when the newspaper won the breaking-news award for its coverage of the Columbine High School tragedy. The Post was a finalist for Pulitzers in 2007 and 2008.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;It sure feels good to win one,&rdquo; Post editor Gregory L. Moore said.</p>
            <p>William Dean Singleton, the chairman and chief executive of MediaNews Group, which owns The Post, said the award is especially sweet coming after a tough year financially for newspapers in Denver.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no moment in a newspaper publisher&rsquo;s life that feels better than having his newspaper win a Pulitzer Prize,&rdquo; Singleton said.</p>
            <h4>&ldquo;He was there for everything&rdquo;</h4>
            <p>Dave Philipps of The Gazette in Colorado Springs was a nominated finalist for the Pulitzer in local reporting for his coverage of soldiers who committed violence after returning to Fort Carson from combat.</p>
            <p>Walker&rsquo;s prize was awarded for the &ldquo;American Soldier&rdquo; project, a three-part series that appeared in The Post in September along with a companion online presentation.</p>
            <p>The series chronicled two years in Fisher&rsquo;s life, beginning with his decision to enlist in the Army after graduation from high school. It was the culmination of an idea hatched by Post editors talking after work one evening. They asked, in the days following the announcement of the troop surge in Iraq: Who would enlist in the Army now?</p>
            <p>Walker first met Fisher at Fisher&rsquo;s high school graduation rehearsal, after being connected through an Army recruiter.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I thought it would be kind of cool, to be honest with you,&rdquo; Fisher said Monday of why he agreed to work with Walker. &ldquo;Little did I know.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Over the following months, Walker followed Fisher through his enlistment and basic training. Walker traveled to Iraq to be with Fisher as he served in Diwaniyah, a volatile area in south-central Iraq. And he was there when Fisher returned home.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;He was there for everything,&rdquo; said Tim Rasmussen, The Post&rsquo;s assistant managing editor for photography. &ldquo;He changed his life to be there when the photos needed to be taken.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Walker&rsquo;s photographs captured Fisher at his most vulnerable &mdash; sitting with an uncertain expression and cradling an injured elbow during his Army processing &mdash; and at his most exalted &mdash; bracing for his crossed-rifles pin to be driven into his chest by a drill sergeant.</p>
            <p>The story was reported by Michael Riley, Bruce Finley and Kevin Simpson.</p>
            <p>Walker thought it would take about a year to complete the project, but it stretched to more than two years when Fisher was assigned to a Fort Carson unit that wasn&rsquo;t due to be deployed for a year.</p>
            <p>It was not an easy journey for Fisher or for Walker.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;There were a lot of ups and downs through Ian&rsquo;s story,&rdquo; Walker said. &ldquo;And I went through those ups and downs. &hellip; The great thing about Ian Fisher is whenever he had a down, it was followed by an up.&rdquo;</p>
            <h4>Selecting the award-winners</h4>
            <p>Fisher&rsquo;s father, Eric, said Walker became a family friend during the story.</p>
            <p>Walker, 43, has been with The Post since 1998. A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Photography, he began his career in Massachusetts, at the Marlborough Enterprise.</p>
            <p>The Pulitzer Prizes are awarded by Columbia University and administered by a board of journalists and educators. Among the board members is Denver Post editor Moore, though he did not participate in discussions on the feature photography category because Walker&rsquo;s entry had been chosen by a nominating jury as a finalist.</p>
            <p>The Pulitzer Board also awarded a special citation to Hank Williams for &ldquo;his craftsmanship as a songwriter who expressed universal feelings with poignant simplicity and played a pivotal role in transforming country music into a major musical and cultural force in American life.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>This is how an American soldier is made. For 27 months, Ian Fisher, his parents and friends, and the U.S. Army allowed a Denver Post photographer and reporters to watch and chronicle his recruitment, induction, training, deployment and, finally, his return from combat. For more than two years Denver Post staff photojournalist Craig F. Walker followed Ian as his life inside and outside of the U.S. Army unfolded.</p>
            <p>The story was written by Kevin Simpson, Michael Riley, Bruce Finley and Craig F. Walker. It was reported by Riley in Colorado and at Fort Benning, Ga., Finley at Fort Carson and in Iraq, and photographer Craig F. Walker throughout.</p>

On his 17th birthday the year before, Ian announced he would join the Army, and he soon did on the delayed-entry program, which prepares recruits for enlistment. He signed up as violence was spiking in Iraq, and he was a sought-after commodity: a physically fit kid with enthusiasm who was &ldquo;in it for God and country,&rdquo; his recruiting commander said. <span class="photog">Craig F.

            <p class="lead">Ian Fisher was looking for a fight. The search took him through countless scraps over girlfriends and teenage trash talk &mdash; he even boxed for a couple of years &mdash; before it transported him from suburban Denver to Diwaniyah, a volatile industrial and agricultural hub in south-central Iraq.

Now he took a pull on his cigarette &mdash; downtime between missions &mdash; and reflected on the circumstances that had transformed his penchant for small-time scuffles into a call to military duty.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What can be better than this?&rdquo; Fisher said. &ldquo;I want to fight. That&rsquo;s why I joined.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>As his days at Bear Creek High School in Lakewood wound down, he&rsquo;d reveled in his emerging reputation as a stand-up guy who would throw down for his buddies. Once, he came home with blood spattered across his T-shirt. He remembered the look from his father, the clipped conversation that followed.</p>

           <p>&ldquo;Is that your blood?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;As a parent, I should probably tell you not to fight &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>And they left it at that.</p>
            <p>On the cusp of adolescence when the Sept. 11 attacks jolted the nation, Fisher eventually felt his combative teenage instincts coalesce with patriotic fervor into something that resembled a career track. On the day he turned 17, he announced he would join the Army &mdash; and soon afterward, he did, on a delayed-entry program that promised him to the infantry immediately after graduation.</p>
            <p>He&rsquo;d never been outside the United States. He knew nothing about Iraq.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, he enlisted during wartime, just as the increasingly unpopular conflict turned its bloodiest and recruiting lagged. He envisioned an elite military career that would train him for the Airborne, where his father served, or even the Rangers. He imagined himself the fearless protector, a patriot who wouldn&rsquo;t back down.</p>
            <p>Over more than two years, the journey from suburban turf to combat zone broke him down and rebuilt him in the hothouse of a boot camp in Georgia. It tested him in California&rsquo;s Mojave Desert and exposed him to the subtle dangers of an assignment too close to home. And it sent him to a country where his fighting instincts met frustration and complex political reality.</p>
            <p>His transformation from local tough to Army grunt also revealed inner conflict as substance abuse, lapses in judgment and clashes with authority threatened to derail his career. Outside forces competed for his allegiance. He felt torn between family&rsquo;s unconditional love and the pull of old friends, between ephemeral romance and uncompromising duty.</p>
            <p>He inspired promise, stumbled and then moved forward.</p>

            <p>Fisher&rsquo;s personal journey paralleled the slow evolution of the U.S. military as a 21st-century fighting force. Engaged in one of the longest wars in its history, the Army struggled to replenish the recruiting pipeline that would supply soldiers for a tactical &ldquo;surge.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>It also underwent a major retooling, from its core officer ranks down to its infantry, to address a changing combat landscape. In the throes of an unconventional war against a faceless insurgency and sectarian strife, the Army now sought to train its soldiers to operate in more sophisticated ways that exploited local political, religious and social conditions.</p>
            <p>But its raw material &mdash; recruits in this all-volunteer force &mdash; had in some ways become less sophisticated and more problematic. The Army relaxed its standards in order to accept more &ldquo;waivers,&rdquo; whose past personal troubles, such as criminal or drug histories, once would have rendered them unfit for duty.</p>
            <p>In contrast to the waivers, Fisher &mdash; fit, eager and intelligent &mdash; looked like a promising prospect.</p>
            <p>Newly arrived in Iraq, anticipating his baptism into combat, he faced a future that would take confounding turns. But he could look back over months of pain and trial and see one thing clearly: Before he could truly call himself an American soldier, he first had to wage a battle with himself.</p>

            <p class="lead">With the all-night party in honor of his enlistment fading into memory, fatigue followed 18-year-old Ian Fisher home along with his best friend, Nick &ldquo;Buddha&rdquo; Nelson. The two of them stretched out on Ian&rsquo;s bed.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
            
    <div class="row">
        <div class="large-6 large-centered medium-6 medium-centered small-11 small-centered columns">    
          <p>It had been a time of emotional goodbyes among friends as Ian prepared to refine his high school persona of the rough-and-tumble teen fumbling for a grip on his future.</p>
            <p>His life had no focus. His last years at Bear Creek saw him marking time, just getting by in the classroom, falling into a routine of hanging out, picking or finishing fights, bouncing from one girlfriend to another.</p>
            <p>He&rsquo;d even abandoned baseball, his childhood passion. Ian threw with a powerful right arm, a gift that guided him to play behind the plate, where his toughness also proved an asset. When a childhood fall from the slippery bed of a pickup shattered his left elbow, doctors thought Ian might need reconstructive surgery. But the injury left the joint slightly misshapen and his baseball career intact.</p>
            <p>And then, junior year, he quit his high school team.</p>
            <p>Outside of baseball, he found camaraderie in a circle of buddies so tight that they got identical tattoos to symbolize their bond. They partied and hung out with friends who had rented an apartment. Once, a cop stopped Ian for driving too fast for snowy conditions with some friends. The deputy spotted signs of alcohol and drug paraphernalia in the car.</p>
            <p>Ian got off with a fine.</p>
            <p>But the future bore down on him. Graduation was looming. His parents wanted him to think about college. Ian didn&rsquo;t see it as a good fit. And though his dad gave him the money for the SAT exam, Ian didn&rsquo;t take the test. He thought about getting married. The current young woman in his life was named Ashley, but she was still a year away from graduation.</p>
            <p>And then there was the Army.</p>
            <p>Few of his classmates considered this route. In fact, as public opinion of the Iraq war plummeted, the presence of recruiters at his high school sometimes prompted angry calls from parents. Yet Ian toyed with the idea of becoming a cop &mdash; and what better training than the military?</p>
            <p>His father, too, had served. Ian&rsquo;s enlistment would add to their bond.</p>
            <p>Now he lit a cigarette and turned on the TV &mdash; but paid little attention. Buddha seemed to be mulling his friend&rsquo;s impending departure. When he spoke, it was to consider Ian&rsquo;s future in the context of a popular children&rsquo;s movie.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Find your Nemo, man,&rdquo; Buddha said. &ldquo;Maybe this is your Nemo. Maybe you&rsquo;ll marry Ashley and have kids. Maybe the Army is your Nemo.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Ian smiled.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We should hang out with my dad,&rdquo; he said.</p>
            <p>Ian headed for the living room, where he flopped on the couch next to his father and draped an arm around him.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You OK?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Eric Fisher said quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m OK.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Eric, 57, had been making his way through an unusual Father&rsquo;s Day. Earlier, he&rsquo;d flicked on the TV news: Personal items belonging to two missing soldiers in Iraq had been found in a terrorist lair &mdash; with no sign whether the soldiers were dead or alive.</p>
            <p>He watched the account with new interest.</p>
            <p>He and Teri Mercill had divorced when Ian was 4, and Eric ultimately assumed primary responsibility for both Ian and his older brother. The breakup wasn&rsquo;t easy on any of them. Andy, then 12, eventually ran away, dropped out of school and bounced in and out of trouble before starting to get his life together. But Ian quickly grew to regard his father as a best friend.</p>
            <p>Eric tried to be strict but forgiving. He&rsquo;d missed the latter quality from his own father, an Army veteran who died before they could reconnect as adults. Eric felt fortunate that he and Ian had developed such a strong bond &mdash; one that would serve as a lifeline to his son in the months ahead.</p>
            <p>Although Eric and Teri weren&rsquo;t built to last as a couple, they remained on good terms after their split. Now, they were about to see their younger son navigate a military culture that had touched them both.</p>
            <p>Teri, a 50-year-old legal secretary in Denver, has a brother who served in the first Gulf War, an uncle who served as a military intelligence officer in Saigon, South Vietnam, and great-uncles who served in the Pacific during World War II. She remembers being pregnant with Ian when the family visited the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where she watched Eric scan the engraved names. It was the only time she saw him cry.</p>
            <p>Teri signed her son&rsquo;s recruitment papers with a shaky hand &mdash; but intense pride.</p>
            <p>Eric, who runs a soil analysis lab for the U.S. Geological Survey, returned from Vietnam with the Combat Infantryman Badge and emotional scars. His father had been awarded the Bronze Star for combat service in World War II.</p>
            <p>Eric didn&rsquo;t care for the way the U.S. was pursuing the Iraq war. Too many similarities to Vietnam. But the fact that Ian chose the military life &mdash; the Army life, in his footsteps &mdash; gave him great satisfaction.</p>
            <p>At the recruiting office, they hammered out the details: a six-year hitch that would keep Ian in the service through 2013; the delayed-entry program that would let him begin as a private first class at a higher pay grade; a $17,000 bonus; and the promise of Airborne and Ranger training.</p>
            <p>Ian appeared to be a motivated kid with one particularly attractive attribute: His popularity meant he could refer several prospects to the recruiter.</p>
            <p>But now, on a sultry June day in 2007, Ian&rsquo;s last hours at home wound down with a trickle of well-wishing friends.</p>
            <p>In the company of Buddha and buddy Shane &ldquo;Pineapple&rdquo; Doiel, Ian packed a few items he thought might help him through basic. A pad of paper, pens, Ashley&rsquo;s rings, an angel pendant, a harmonica, an address book, two journals and a Bible.</p>
            <p>As the sky turned dusky, Ian joined his father on the driveway to await the recruiter&rsquo;s arrival. They smoked. They strained their necks at the sound of every oncoming car. Just as Ian snuffed out his cigarette and headed inside, another vehicle approached.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; Eric called.</p>
            <p>Ian threw his bag into the front seat. He walked Buddha and Shane to their car, where the three of them hugged, eyes closed. When Ian opened his, they were wet with tears. They embraced again.</p>
            <p>Ian approached his father, waiting by the recruiter&rsquo;s vehicle.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You got everything?&rdquo; Eric whispered.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The car pulled out. Eric and Shane flashed peace signs. Buddha placed his hand over his heart.</p>
            <p>Then Ian was gone.</p>

The roughly 200 recruits are then given two minutes to sort through a pile of duffel bags to find their own. It&rsquo;s an impossible task that&rsquo;s repeated over and over. &ldquo;We see who&rsquo;s going to quit in that first hour,&rdquo; says drill sergeant John Eldridge, who is going through his last cycle of basic training and warned recruits, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t piss me off.&rdquo; <span class="photog">Craig F.

            <p class="lead">Late the next day, Ian Fisher rode a charter bus from the Atlanta airport to Fort Benning, where his processing into the U.S. Army began with a welcome from a barking drill sergeant shortly after midnight.</p>

          <p>The three-day prelude to boot camp continued as the recruits were hustled into a basement at the reception station. Supply clerks issued the immediate necessities: socks, underwear, towels, shirts and shorts. The recruits were shown their barracks and bunks and told to get some sleep.</p>
            <p>Forty-five minutes later, reveille blared over loudspeakers.</p>
            <p>Intense physical training and high-decibel harassment still lay ahead. But processing, after a 22-hour day and little sleep, offered the first suggestions that the recruits had entered a new and different culture.</p>
            <p>Fisher, assigned to Bravo Company, gave blood samples that could provide DNA identification if he were killed. He learned his pay &mdash; $1,587 a month &mdash; and received a debit card to use at the PX. All but a bristly nub of his hair hit the floor. He received two sets of combat uniforms.</p>
            <p>He filled out forms. He stood in formation. He joined the others in constant repetition of the Soldier&rsquo;s Creed: &ldquo;&hellip; I will always place the mission first; I will never accept defeat; I will never quit; I will never leave a fallen comrade. &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
            <p>He had barely settled in, but already Fisher looked worn.</p>
            <p>On the evening of the first full day at Fort Benning, he complained that he&rsquo;d injured his left elbow when he slipped and fell on a stairway, aggravating his childhood injury. He went to the infirmary for an X-ray.</p>
            <p>The next morning, he was told that doctors would need to see his records and do more tests. He also learned that the childhood injury, which he&rsquo;d never mentioned in an exhaustive medical questionnaire, might disqualify him from service.</p>

The injury might disqualify him from military service, and at first, he was open to the prospect. But after talking with a commander, Fisher was ready to move on to basic training. &ldquo;This scared me more than anything ever has,&rdquo; Fisher said. &ldquo;&hellip; I&rsquo;m already feeling like a different person.&rdquo; <span class="photog">Craig F.

            <p>But the Army had questions. Fisher wouldn&rsquo;t be the first recruit with second thoughts to fake an injury in hope of heading home. For six hours, he and the Army waged a battle of wills.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of being treated like (expletive),&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all I want &mdash; just to leave. I&rsquo;m scared. I&rsquo;m sad. And I&rsquo;m angry.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>But after Fisher met with a commander and talked things through, the world looked different. He wanted to stay.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;This scared me more than anything ever has,&rdquo; he said of the jolting arrival at Fort Benning.</p>
            <p>Within a span of 48 hours, his entire frame of reference had shifted. He&rsquo;d joined the Army to make a different life. Now that life was upon him.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I just keep telling myself to be happy,&rdquo; Fisher said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m already feeling like a different person.&rdquo;</p>

            <p class="lead">Fisher and the rest of his new unit marched along a quiet, pleasantly wooded road from the processing center on their way to begin 14 weeks of basic training. The drill sergeants coaxed them along with benign smiles, thank-yous and gosh-darns, until the recruits stood in a field before a 20-foot-high mound of duffel bags.</p>
            </div>

  <div class="row">
        <div class="large-6 large-centered medium-6 medium-centered small-11 small-centered columns">
          <p>That&rsquo;s when everything changed.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;When I give you the command of ‘Go!,&rsquo; you are going to have two minutes to secure your bag and get back in your position,&rdquo; bellowed 1st Sgt. Brian Clarke to roughly 200 recruits standing before him. &ldquo;Is that understood?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>At his command, piped-in sound effects of an artillery barrage pierced the quiet. Air-raid sirens blared. Babies cried &mdash; at a deafening decibel level. Drill sergeants swarmed and screamed.</p>
            <p>It was a rigged game. The recruits frantically but futilely tossed aside bags in search of their own. They paid for their ineptitude with push-ups to a cadence that crackled over a bullhorn. Faces clenched in the Georgia heat. Sweat dripped.</p>
            <p>Then they tried again and failed. And again &mdash; this time, one recruit hunched over and vomited. The scene became a morass of stress, disorientation and exhaustion.</p>
            <p>In other words, an unqualified success.</p>
            <p>For about 40 years, the exercise known as the &ldquo;shark attack&rdquo; or &ldquo;bag drill&rdquo; has provided Army recruits with a shocking introduction to basic training. It sets the tone for the first three weeks of boot camp &mdash; &ldquo;red phase,&rdquo; in military parlance &mdash; when anxiety, physical exertion, sleep deprivation and isolation open the door to a recruit&rsquo;s psyche.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;There is some science to this,&rdquo; said Col. Casey P. Haskins, the brigade commander who oversaw training of 20,000 infantry recruits a year at Fort Benning. &ldquo;An adult fundamentally won&rsquo;t change his values through a logical discussion. It requires a significant emotional event. That provides us an opening, a very brief opening. In that time, we have to pour through and cause them to be open to the possibility of accepting what we&rsquo;re telling them.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s a period in which the recruits have little freedom of movement and virtually no independent decision-making ability. Exacting rules work hand in hand with punishing consequences.</p>
            <p>In some ways, the isolation proved most onerous. For many of the young privates, the Army chaperoned their first trip away from home. A couple of the men in Fisher&rsquo;s platoon had left behind pregnant wives or girlfriends, whose own struggles with the separation created additional stress for the recruits.</p>
            <p>The drill sergeants&rsquo; advice: Suck it up, soldier.</p>

He had been consistently causing problems at basic training, and the rest of the platoon was paying the price. Because of the culture of basic training, where all suffer for the faults of one, recruits often police their own ranks. Fisher said he worried that the pep talks for his bunkmate might not be enough but he wouldn&rsquo;t be part of any physical confrontation. &ldquo;I told him I&rsquo;d be there for him,&rdquo; Fisher said. &ldquo;But he just doesn&rsquo;t seem to care.&rdquo; <span class="photog">Craig F.

            <p>In Fisher&rsquo;s 2nd Platoon, John Eldridge, a bullish munitions expert weathered beyond his 46 years, represented the Old School, right out of Hollywood&rsquo;s central casting, grounded in physical training and discipline. He led recruits in exercises with names like Mountain Man, Crocodile and Iron Mike and extolled the virtues of an Army that had allowed him to see the world.</p>
            <p>Along the way, he&rsquo;d also lost a marriage. He offered relationship wisdom: If you get a Dear John letter, don&rsquo;t let it affect your training; there are more and better fish in the sea. The advice easily could be translated to MySpace or Facebook &mdash; where, in the modern military, long-distance relationships lived and died.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;This is my last cycle,&rdquo; Eldridge warned 2nd Platoon. &ldquo;So don&rsquo;t piss me off.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Tommy Beauchamp, the chief drill sergeant, represented the &ldquo;new&rdquo; Army, focused on skills and efficiency. A Special Forces sniper who had seen duty in Afghanistan and Iraq, Beauchamp refused to pin the infantry&rsquo;s crossed rifles on the chest of any man he wouldn&rsquo;t serve alongside.</p>
            <p>Natural attrition alone proved a potent screen: One-fifth of Fisher&rsquo;s 40-man platoon would be gone within eight weeks. Half of those would succumb to physical injury. Half would simply quit, go AWOL in the middle of the night.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Just so you understand,&rdquo; Eldridge barked early in basic training, &ldquo;this is our little (expletive) world. You cannot beat us.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Fisher struggled with the physical demands. He focused on surviving this ordeal, and even two days into basic, he already had scaled back his expectations of joining the Rangers. But emotionally, he seemed to adapt well.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;For some reason, I&rsquo;m a lot happier,&rdquo; Fisher said near the end of the first week. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve pretty much given up on the life that I had, honestly.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Even the hard-bitten Eldridge could see the young recruit&rsquo;s upside.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s starting to come out of his shell,&rdquo; the drill sergeant said. &ldquo;Fisher has potential to be a leader. He just needs someone to put a foot in his ass to get him to do it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Others failed to adjust to the regimented life. Fisher&rsquo;s bunkmate, an 18-year-old who had been in and out of jail in his hometown of Syracuse, N.Y., joined the Army as a last resort &mdash; unlike Fisher, he was a &ldquo;waiver&rdquo; who&rsquo;d been accepted in spite of his personal troubles. He said he &ldquo;wanted to straighten up and turn into a hero or something.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>It wasn&rsquo;t happening. Meanwhile, his behavior repeatedly triggered the drill sergeants&rsquo; wrath and earned punishment for the whole unit. Fisher began to worry for the kid. A certain amount of self-policing takes place within a platoon, and the 2nd seemed on the verge of meting out its own physical punishment.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to take part in it because I&rsquo;m not that kind of person,&rdquo; Fisher said. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s going to get hurt. The kid just makes stupid mistakes over and over &mdash; and it hurts us. I told him I&rsquo;d be there for him.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;But he just doesn&rsquo;t seem to care.&rdquo;</p>

           <p>Lt. Col. Donald Okura, the training battalion commander, thanked the young men for joining in a time of war, and then proceeded to explain the moral precepts designed to guide American soldiers.</p>
            <p>His talk came at a moment when the Army still grappled with some fundamental problems of fighting an insurgency in a politically charged landscape. It faced a daunting task: Train soldiers to kill; then teach them where to draw the line.</p>
            <p>Incidents in Iraq like the mistreatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison, and the way that fiasco hindered U.S. ability to counter the insurgency, provided the impetus for this training. Okura flashed onto the screen some of the now-infamous photographs that ignited anger against the U.S. presence.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the worst thing about this?&rdquo; Okura asked. &ldquo;It damaged the reputation of the Army. In your training here, you will never be taught to take prisoners of war and punch them in the back of the neck. You will never be taught to tie them up to electrical wires. You will never be taught that, because that&rsquo;s not the behavior of soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Following his lecture, the recruits &mdash; some of whom nodded off and were culled from the crowd by drill sergeants for punitive push-ups &mdash; watched scenes from &ldquo;Saving Private Ryan.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Afterward, Fisher and others wrestled with the concept of a clear line of moral behavior. They wrestled with it again about eight weeks into basic, when an ambulance siren jolted Echo Company from sleep.</p>

            <p>Four members of 4th Platoon had jumped one of their own as he returned to the barracks late one night. His transgression: He had violated rules by sneaking out and using the phone. The beating shattered his jaw and required reconstructive surgery.</p>
            <p>They had crossed that line.</p>
            <p>The occasional fight after lights-out wasn&rsquo;t the issue &mdash; that was almost expected in boot camp as the recruits sought to bring wayward comrades into line and enforce lessons of shared responsibility.</p>
            <p>But each platoon developed its own personality, and 4th Platoon had a disturbing edge. One of its drill sergeants, a 24-year-old veteran of two Iraq tours, felt an urgency to impart the realities of combat to his new recruits. To that end, he&rsquo;d shown them his own battlefield videos.</p>
            <p>Technically, it was a violation of regulations. Practically, it hammered home the stark and brutal truth about what could lie ahead. And unquestionably, it fostered a less disciplined atmosphere.</p>
            <p>A clique of privates, including the platoon leader, had made a habit out of pursuing and punishing the unit&rsquo;s weaker links for even minor infractions. In late-night beatings, they&rsquo;d keep their blows to the body to minimize physical evidence.</p>
            <p>But even the occasional black eye would be dismissed by the shamed victim as an accident, a fall down the stairs. One 4th Platoon private had been nicknamed &ldquo;Spot&rdquo; in deference to his constant shiner.</p>
            <p>Shadraq McBride, a member of 4th Platoon who later transferred to 2nd, described the culture of fear that the clique of violent leaders enforced.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The group up there was just more jumpy,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;If you did what you were supposed to do, were squared away, you&rsquo;d be fine. If you didn&rsquo;t, it was tough.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>In the wake of the shattered jaw, even the sergeants took notice. The four privates responsible for the beating were isolated from the rest of the company, with their bunks and gear moved to the common area. And 1st Sgt. Clarke spoke firmly to Echo Company&rsquo;s drill sergeants.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The assaults &mdash; all this ‘I fell down the stairs&rsquo; crap &mdash; that needs to end now,&rdquo; he told them.</p>
            <p>Within hours after the ambulance sped the injured soldier away, Echo Company&rsquo;s commander, 24-year-old West Point graduate Capt. Tom Koh, paced before the soldiers in his unit. He knew he had to prepare them to get the job done on the battlefield. Yet he also needed to emphasize the moral parameters.</p>
            <p>Koh scolded the recruits for the beating incident. Then he told the story of the 1968 My Lai massacre &mdash; that dark chapter from Vietnam in which American soldiers slaughtered more than 300 unarmed civilians.</p>
            <p>He explained how a young helicopter pilot, Hugh Thompson Jr., had mitigated the carnage by landing and putting himself between other Americans and the Vietnamese to stop the killing &mdash; an act that exposed him to virulent criticism at first but later was recognized as heroic.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;That soldier had the values of personal courage and the discipline to stop what he knew was wrong,&rdquo; Koh said. &ldquo;My overall goal is that you guys understand values and</p>
            <p>discipline.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;And we need to get some.&rdquo;</p>

            <p class="lead">The first eight weeks had been difficult in many ways &mdash; but perhaps none so much as understanding how values and discipline played out in 21st-century combat.</p>

            <p>Fisher had watched graphic videos. He saw an Iraqi man being shot several times for refusing to obey a command. He saw a tank crush a man. He learned how to search the dead body of an enemy.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I almost feel like I&rsquo;m going crazy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Like I don&rsquo;t have feelings anymore. It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;m this soldier, I&rsquo;m being trained to go to Iraq, to kill people and possibly be killed.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I mean, what&rsquo;s left?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Haskins, regarded as one of the Army&rsquo;s rising stars, had been charged with instituting a top-down review of the way things were done at Fort Benning. His goal: produce &ldquo;thinking soldiers led by thinking leaders.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Part of that equation involved understanding situations in a way that would lead to the most judicious use of force &mdash; a factor that was lacking at the start of the Iraq war, in his view.</p>
            <p>The new wave of recruits was being taught largely by soldiers who had experienced the lessons learned from Iraq and Afghanistan, where the battlefield loomed more nuanced and complex than in previous wars.</p>
            <p>Koh hoped to pound home how isolated mistakes and miscalculations could sabotage a larger military strategy &mdash; that was the lesson that had to be learned from the 4th Platoon private&rsquo;s unconscionable beating.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Any one of these privates, within a few months, could be the gunner on a gun truck,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Within seconds, he has to make a moral, tactical decision about a car speeding up to a checkpoint.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Do I engage? Do I engage to kill?&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Nearly five years into the Iraq war, recruiting had become more difficult, especially for the more dangerous slots like infantry. Not only had incentives like signing bonuses spiked to lure more young men into the ranks, but recruiters also had lowered the bar to entry.</p>
            <p>The Army issued more waivers to overlook shortcomings that previously would have kept an individual out of the service: a criminal record, medical issues, low academic achievement.</p>
            <p>Unknown even to the sergeants before the beating incident, Echo Company had an unusually high number of waivers in its ranks &mdash; nearly 80 recruits, or about 40 percent of the company.</p>
            <p>It was the highest concentration of waivers the instructors had ever trained &mdash; a test case whose performance the Army wanted to track. (It experienced no higher attrition than the approximate 10 percent average, Haskins would later learn.)</p>
            <p>But in the midst of basic, pressures in camp and at home moved several of the young soldiers to go AWOL.</p>
            <p>At least seven recruits from 2nd Platoon would try to run. The AWOL rate surprised even the experienced drill sergeants. And 4th Platoon&rsquo;s beating incident exposed a troubling discipline problem.</p>
            <p>In the end, two of the offending 4th Platoon privates were tossed out of the Army. Two others had to restart basic training. The platoon was disbanded, with its remaining members dispersed among the other three.</p>
            <p>Slowly, life returned to a routine in Georgia&rsquo;s stifling August heat.</p>
            <p>Fisher learned to operate the &ldquo;SAW,&rdquo; or Squad Automatic Weapon &mdash; the M-249, a 17-pound light machine gun that can provide firepower approximating a larger weapon but with greater accuracy and mobility. He wrote letters to his dad, his mom and a friend named Kayla he knew from Lakewood. He hadn&rsquo;t heard from his girlfriend, Ashley, but he was surprised when he received a letter from Kayla.</p>
            <p>He hung her picture in his locker. And he thought about his buddies back home.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Every morning, I wake up and I wonder what Buddha&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s either drinking or sleeping.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The trials of boot camp also served to sharpen Fisher&rsquo;s sense of why he had joined the Army. He watched the others go AWOL and figured, It would be easy. I could sleep in my own bed. But then he&rsquo;d recalibrate his purpose.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Everyone said, ‘Don&rsquo;t change who you are,&rsquo; &ldquo; Fisher said. &ldquo;But I really have. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m a little scared to go home. This place is kind of becoming home.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the sergeants sought to refocus Echo Company.</p>
            <p>A simulated raid on an insurgent village demanded that the platoons put into practice much of what they&rsquo;d learned. Koh briefed the men on their objective: Assault a mock-up cluster of buildings and observation platforms guarded by insurgents wielding AK-47s. Expect booby traps, IEDs and other surprises.</p>
            <p>In the morning, 2nd Platoon&rsquo;s &ldquo;fire squads&rdquo; made their way uphill through low brush and prepared to storm the buildings and clear them, room by room. Then they heard their signal: A bank of machine guns opened up on their left.</p>
            <p>Fisher&rsquo;s squad was still 15 yards from the first doorway when it was taken out by an IED, although Beauchamp ruled that the bomb would have killed only half the squad and allowed Fisher and four others to continue.</p>
            <p>Another squad entered an already secured building and failed to shout the prearranged signal: &ldquo;War eagle! War eagle! Coming in!&rdquo; The soldiers who had secured the building opened fire &mdash; and &ldquo;killed&rdquo; five members of their own platoon.</p>
            <p>All told, 18 members of 2nd Platoon died in the drill.</p>
            <p>It was Echo Company&rsquo;s first big exercise &mdash; and a fiasco. As the disappointed instructors took stock afterward, they lamented the lack of leadership and could take solace only in the fact that there were still weeks of training to go.</p>
            <p>Time to fix mistakes. Time to improve.</p>

            <p class="lead">Ultimately, 13 weeks of basic training led Ian Fisher to this &mdash; a 10-mile march in the thick, damp Georgia heat through a series of combat tests that would end, for those who endured, at a place called Honor Hill.</p>

  <div class="row">
        <div class="large-6 large-centered medium-6 medium-centered small-11 small-centered columns">



            <p>It had been a time of struggle and transformation.</p>
            <p>Fisher&rsquo;s initial fears subsided as the disciplined military culture supplanted his free-flowing suburban upbringing. The Army had poured through the cracks in his identity produced by those early days of shocking mental stress and challenged him, toughened him and given him a glimpse of his potential.</p>
            <p>It also had given him a cold, hard appraisal of his limitations. His ambitions of moving on to Airborne and Ranger training had dissolved amid repeated and futile efforts to pass his physical training. Injuries, including a possible stress fracture in his pelvis, had hindered his performance, yet he was reluctant to report them for fear of being set back in his training.</p>
            <p>Fisher did a reality check: Instead of excellence, he would settle for survival.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Right now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just about completing the next step. It&rsquo;s about moving to the next level.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>A week of field training exercises had plunged Fisher and the rest of Echo Company into a sweaty, stinking gantlet of maneuvers in the Georgia woods. Heat rash covered his back, his chest, his neck &mdash; &ldquo;like a thousand needles.&rdquo; Temperatures hit 100 degrees. Humidity coaxed even more sweat from their bodies, soaked their uniforms and fermented into a sour stench.</p>
            <p>Now, basic training had wound down to one final maneuver, which would culminate with a brutal uphill slog to the elaborate, ceremonial pinning of the crossed rifles on the chest of each private.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Blood rifles,&rdquo; they call it, because the drill sergeants drive the pins through the uniform and into flesh.</p>
            <p>Members of the 2nd Platoon bushwhacked through forest with 65 pounds of gear strapped to their backs. They fended off two IED attacks and enemy fire. They crossed a river and executed three missions, including the simulated rescue of a downed pilot. Two miles farther, they reached a village and secured a two-story building held by the enemy. They battled fatigue and dehydration.</p>
            <p>Then they marched into the night.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Once again, it&rsquo;s the theory of the mind,&rdquo; Beauchamp told them during a canteen break. &ldquo;All your weak minds telling you that you can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>When they reached the last, long climb, the sounds of groaning and panting hung in the humid darkness. Blisters burned and bled. When one recruit fell behind, others propped him up.</p>
            <p>At the top of the rise, heavy-metal music blared from mammoth speakers behind a wooden enclosure. As the privates filed inside, they saw huge bonfires illuminating a stage at one end. At the other, wisps of dry-ice steam spilled from a giant cauldron. Seven torches represented famous American infantry battles through history.</p>
            <p>The glow from two others signified, as one sergeant announced, &ldquo;battles we are currently fighting and winning.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The World Trade Center, the USS Cole, the embassies in Tanzania and Kenya were the first strikes of a new war, a global war on terror, a war which will be fought on many fronts the world over by the infantrymen of today and tomorrow,&rdquo; the sergeant continued. &ldquo;You are now the guardian of freedom and the American way of life!</p>
            <p>&ldquo;A warrior!&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The scene was one part patriotic pep rally, one part Hollywood stagecraft. But for those who had survived basic training &mdash; about one-third of 2nd Platoon did not &mdash; and endured the final march to this moment, the atmosphere seemed an appropriate touch.</p>
            <p>What happened next would seal them into a brotherhood.</p>
            <p>Stepping through the semi-darkness, the drill sergeants approached each private and presented him the crossed rifles. Drill sergeant John Eldridge hammered the two-pronged pin into Fisher&rsquo;s chest with his fist, drawing blood.</p>

             <p class="lead">Basic training didn&rsquo;t begin to prepare Ian Fisher for military life. For that, the Army announced it was sending him home to Colorado to begin his duties as a soldier at Fort Carson with the Iraq-bound 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division.

            <p>Things didn&rsquo;t start well.</p>
            <p>In mid-October of 2007, on his fifth day of processing, Fisher met the company commander, Capt. Walter Dunn. First, he made the mistake of entering the room without knocking. Ordered to try again, Fisher knocked but then failed to salute. Instructed to salute, he failed to hold his salute until the captain finished.</p>
            <p>He tried again and got it right.</p>
            <p>Some rules here were simple protocols. Some, like his platoon sergeant&rsquo;s creed &mdash; don&rsquo;t be late, don&rsquo;t lie, don&rsquo;t steal &mdash; were inviolable commandments clearly expressed on Day One. Others were unspoken, until broken.</p>

            <p>One afternoon, Fisher wandered into his barracks and found several platoon veterans, most in their mid-20s, recounting previous deployments to Iraq. Jaymeson Wilcox, a sergeant who had received the Purple Heart, told how a roadside bomb in 2004 had sent shrapnel into his neck, burned his skin and left him unconscious.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I want to know what it&rsquo;s like to be hit by an IED,&rdquo; blurted Fisher, 18 but still caught up in a neophyte&rsquo;s curiosity about combat. &ldquo;I think it would be fun.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The veterans bristled.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing you want to go through,&rdquo; Wilcox said.</p>
            <p>Afterward, Sgt. Randy Armstrong called Fisher aside. Armstrong, who before joining the Army had served four years as a Marine and helped spearhead the 2003 Iraq invasion, instructed him on keeping his mouth shut and knowing his place.</p>
            <p>He ordered the private first class to write the name of every U.S. soldier killed to that point in Iraq. When Fisher submitted a computer printout of the names, Armstrong ordered him to write them by hand.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I basically learned my place,&rdquo; Fisher said afterward. &ldquo;I joined the Army not really knowing what the Army was. Basic training isn&rsquo;t Army life. Until I got to this unit, I didn&rsquo;t know what it was to actually live as a soldier.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Basic training had put some geographic and psychological distance between Fisher and the unfocused life he&rsquo;d sought to put behind him. And while he loved his family and friends, he took pride in the changes that had begun to shape him into something more than an aimless teen whose life revolved around buddies, parties and girlfriends.</p>
            <p>Now he faced an internal struggle to forge a productive future, one he&rsquo;d have to wage on a difficult battlefield &mdash; his home turf. With his old Jefferson County stomping ground only about an hour&rsquo;s drive up Interstate 25, the lure of civilian life, and its freedoms, distracted his development as a soldier.</p>

            <p>Training at Fort Carson aimed at getting these soldiers to Iraq within months. In a large, darkened room, he engaged the enemy in what resembled a life-sized video game that provides the groundwork for later live-fire techniques. He took part in urban combat exercises. He attended classes called Combat Life Savers and Enemy Prisoner of War. He was lectured on alcohol awareness, cold-weather survival and suicide prevention. </p>
            <p>He took physical training tests &mdash; and repeatedly failed to do the required 53 sit-ups in two minutes or complete a 2-mile run in the required 15:54. He drilled diligently on the firing range, scoring high on his marksmanship.</p>
            <p>Designated the SAW gunner, for Squad Automatic Weapon, he handled the M-249 light machine gun that he&rsquo;d first encountered in basic. He learned to scan for IEDs and identify suicide bombers and ambushes while rolling through towns and along open roads.</p>
            <p>By mid-December, Ian was looking forward to a weekend off. After helping his dad move from his Lakewood house to a new home near Morrison, he and his new girlfriend, Kayla, headed off to do some Christmas shopping at a Littleton mall.</p>
            <p>Passing through the food court, the couple bumped into Ashley, Ian&rsquo;s previous romantic interest. They shared an awkward hug and some small talk.</p>
            <p>Ian and Kayla clasped hands and continued through the mall. As they approached a jewelry store, Ian turned to her.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Hey, you want to go ring shopping?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
            <p>Kayla smiled and nodded.</p>

            <p>They had met in freshman math class but never really dated. She wrote to him during basic training, and once they reconnected when Ian returned, she decided to give the relationship a chance while he served at Fort Carson.</p>
            <p>Soon after, they talked marriage, although Ian had yet to officially propose.</p>
            <p>They decided on a ring in about five minutes: a princess-cut diamond set in white gold. Ian filled out a credit application. The store clerk helped them crunch numbers until they figured out how he would pay for it.</p>
            <p>On Christmas Day, Ian gathered with Kayla&rsquo;s family and fidgeted while presents were opened. It took him the better part of an hour to muster the courage to ask for her hand while relatives looked on.</p>
            <p>He explained that he and Kayla had been best of friends for four years and wanted to take the relationship to the next level. He talked about wanting to be part of her family, about still having a lot of learning to do but hoping to prove that they can &ldquo;take on something this heavy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>He glided to one knee before Kayla.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;But at this time, I would love to ask you &hellip; if you will marry me.&rdquo;</p>

He had been taken off duty since an ankle injury earlier in the week. While his platoon reacted to a nighttime &ldquo;attack,&rdquo; Ian had to stay back but still took part in the training exercise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think I&rsquo;m made of glass,&rdquo; Fisher said of his latest injury.

             <p class="lead">On Super Tuesday, the early February day in 2008 when the national political landscape was being reshaped, Fisher spent his day monitoring communications from an armored personnel carrier and guarding an ammunition tent &mdash; on crutches &mdash; while his unit performed training exercises on the Fort Carson grounds.

            <p>Outside the tent, Fisher smoked a cigarette and explained his injury to Brent Nixon, a 20-year-old private from California. He had been most of the way through a 3-mile run when he&rsquo;d stepped into a pothole and rolled his ankle.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Honestly,&rdquo; Fisher said, &ldquo;the first thing that went through my head was, ‘Yes! I don&rsquo;t have to go out into the field.&rsquo; And look where I am now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;In the field,&rdquo; Nixon laughed.</p>
            <p>Nixon already had served one tour in Iraq and wasn&rsquo;t sure he would be deployed again. He told Fisher that during his first tour, he had survived 10 IEDs and expected to get a medical discharge from the Army because of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury, which affected his short-term memory.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;You say your name,&rdquo; Nixon said, &ldquo;and five minutes later I&rsquo;ll forget. It&rsquo;s a real problem when I go on dates.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Fisher&rsquo;s relatively minor training injuries had resulted in prescriptions for pain medications and muscle relaxants. The bottles accumulated in a drawer in his room.</p>
            <p>During a visit home, Ian sat at the dining room table showing his dad a new tattoo. Beside him on the table sat his weekend necessities &mdash; cellphone, energy drink, cigarettes and a bottle of Vicodin.</p>
            <p>He rationalized his reliance: He didn&rsquo;t want the Army to profile him as a faker. He had seen others scorned as malingerers for using physical issues to dodge duty. He had already been allowed to slide on his running during physical training. Better to just take the painkillers and soldier on as best he could.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;About my Vicodin?&rdquo; Ian asked.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, why? Because I think you&rsquo;re abusing them,&rdquo; Eric said. &ldquo;You keep taking those as recreational and you&rsquo;re going to end up immune to them. They&rsquo;re not going to do you any good. Look at you &mdash; you&rsquo;re shaking a mile a minute.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not shaking,&rdquo; Ian insisted, holding up his hand. It trembled visibly.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Eric said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re just twitching like crazy. So be truthful with me. Are you taking those things 24/7?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;How often are you taking them?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;As needed.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What do you mean, ‘as needed&rsquo;?&rdquo; Eric pressed. &ldquo;Needed for what?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Pain.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Pain my ass,&rdquo; Eric continued. &ldquo;What pain do you have on weekends?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>They dropped the subject, but the issue festered. Eric already had begun to realize that his son&rsquo;s assignment to Fort Carson had become a problem. Too close to home. Too much girl trouble. Too many weekends spent partying with old friends. Too many temptations.</p>
            <p>He worried that his son had charted a dangerous course.</p>
            <p>Only days later, though, Ian Fisher appeared upbeat as his company prepared to head into the field for training at Fort Carson&rsquo;s Camp Red Devil. He and the rest of his unit piled into their Bradleys and began a two-hour trip that, owing to mechanical breakdowns, ended up taking nine.</p>
            <p>Inside the Bradley, the constant rumble of the engine mixed with the thick odor of diesel fuel. As the vehicle crawled along, the soldiers&rsquo; heads bobbled. Fisher zoned out and let his mind go blank.</p>

            <p>When they arrived at their simulated forward operating base the next morning, the door to the vehicle swung open to reveal a surreal scene of Bradleys and tanks spread across the starkly beautiful landscape of rolling hills colored by tall, dry grass, red dirt and cactuses stretching to the mountains.</p>
            <p>Squad leader Armstrong marked off an imaginary &ldquo;glass house&rdquo; by using soldiers&rsquo; helmets to signify the building&rsquo;s corners and entryways. Fisher and three others created a formation called a &ldquo;four-man stack&rdquo; and practiced entering and clearing a room. One soldier, a recent arrival from boot camp, repeatedly failed to execute the maneuver properly.</p>
            <p>In a later drill, Fisher played the role of an insurgent and lay on the ground while, one by one, the others took turns searching him. Then Armstrong led them through individual and team &ldquo;bounding&rdquo; techniques &mdash; the maneuver a soldier uses to advance on an enemy without making himself an easy target.</p>
            <p>They finished the morning session with a march to the top of a mountain spur before heading back. Then they sat quietly, resting against the side of their Bradley, and cleaned their weapons. Armstrong advised them to take care of personal hygiene.</p>
            <p>Nobody moved.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; the sergeant finally said, raising his voice in a parental crescendo, &ldquo;if you didn&rsquo;t brush your teeth this morning &hellip; brush your teeth!&rdquo;</p>
            <p>One soldier pointed to the toothbrush Fisher was using &mdash; to clean his SAW.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Fisher laughed, &ldquo;I guess I care more about my gun than I do myself.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Late that afternoon, the platoon returned to the field and did more stack maneuvers on more &ldquo;glass houses.&rdquo; Armstrong grew frustrated with the unit&rsquo;s inability to get it right &mdash; especially because he anticipated that many of their missions in Iraq would take place in urban environments and close quarters.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Clearing a room needs to be second nature to a soldier,&rdquo; he chastised them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be muscle memory. I&rsquo;m not making you do this over and over because I like watching you run around out here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>By 5 the next morning, the platoon was on the move for that day&rsquo;s maneuver &mdash; the capture of a man named Abu Buchta, a fictional target believed to attend prayers at the village mosque. About 30 Iraqi-Americans, hired through a contractor, played the parts of the villagers.</p>
            <p>One of them, 40-year-old Joe Chamsi, moved to the U.S. from Baghdad in 1987 and spoke five languages. He played the role of interpreter. He&rsquo;d taken the job in the hope that by teaching American soldiers about Iraqi culture, he might save lives.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I want the soldiers to be educated when they go to Iraq,&rdquo; Chamsi said. &ldquo;If there is less shooting, less soldiers die. And less mothers and fathers die.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>In the drill, the platoon had to coordinate with the local police force to apprehend the target. Though the first effort failed, the second attempt went a little more smoothly.</p>
            <p>One squad entered the village cautiously and took enemy fire. Fisher&rsquo;s squad followed on foot and quickly secured one building. While the soldiers negotiated with the &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; for his assistance, the target was found and captured.</p>
            <p>In the workday world of the 4th Infantry Division, Fisher finally seemed to be finding his rhythm.</p>
            <p>It didn&rsquo;t last.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="large-6 large-centered medium-6 medium-centered small-11 small-centered columns">
            <p>On a Monday morning in late March, Ian was getting ready to go to lunch with his mom in downtown Denver before heading back to Fort Carson. But emotions had overtaken him, a mixture of anger, heartache and regret arriving on the heels of another weekend at home, partying with friends.</p>
            <p>He snapped.</p>
            <p>He and a platoon buddy, 17-year-old Jonathan Duenez, were due back at the post by 2 p.m. It didn&rsquo;t look as if they would make it &mdash; or that they intended to.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;My mom&rsquo;s scared,&rdquo; Ian said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even tell my dad because he&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s so proud of me, so proud of who I&rsquo;ve become. I can&rsquo;t bring myself to tell my dad that I&rsquo;ve become so weak and I&rsquo;m doing so many stupid things in my life.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Late that afternoon, though, Ian did call his father &mdash; half-crying, saying he just couldn&rsquo;t take this anymore, that he was coming home, that he was going AWOL. For about a half-hour, Eric tried to calm him down. But when they hung up, he still worried.</p>
            <p>Finally, about 8 p.m., Ian stood at his front door, along with Duenez.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; Eric asked.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ian said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been in the Army. We&rsquo;re here to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Eric took stock of the situation. Duenez simply looked like a homesick kid, not long out of basic, missing his family and girlfriend back home. He followed Ian&rsquo;s lead, and then their mutual unhappiness spiraled into something like desperation.</p>
            <p>And the driving force in Ian&rsquo;s emotional meltdown, Eric figured, was his proximity to home. At the start, it had seemed that the posting to Fort Carson was a blessing. Not anymore. He offered simple counsel.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Maybe you need to quit coming home so often &mdash; get into this military thing,&rdquo; Eric told his son. &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t realize you&rsquo;re in the military yet, by coming home every weekend. Maybe you need to stay down there.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The two soldiers returned the next day. They marked time with menial duty as they awaited their punishment for taking an unauthorized long weekend. Their platoon sergeant, Joshua Weisensel, pronounced sentence: 14 days of extra duty, a $300 fine.</p>

            <p>The National Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif., covers 1,200 square miles of arid flats and jagged mountains between Los Angeles and Las Vegas where each year 50,000 U.S. soldiers go through a series of carefully designed scenarios. Military contractors have constructed replicas of Iraqi villages inhabited by role-playing Iraqi-Americans.</p>
            <p>Production crews gave battle scenes authenticity, right down to simulated bomb blasts and bloody amputations. It marked the closest to reality that an untested soldier could experience before shipping out.</p>
            <p>In one early exercise, Fisher&rsquo;s unit, led by Armstrong, rumbled along in four Humvees toward a mountain objective. They traversed a steep slope in search of potential enemy mortar pits.</p>
            <p>Armstrong, who had grown up poor in rural Arkansas, already had seen combat in Iraq. Now, he looked at the soldiers under his command and saw kids who seemed sheltered and soft.</p>
            <p>He needed to change that in order to bring them home alive from Iraq.</p>
            <p>On a landscape strewn with boulders, scrub oak and cactus, where black lizards intermittently scurried across the terrain, Armstrong ordered his men to fan out and climb toward a ridgeline, searching for evidence of mortar launch sites.</p>
            <p>They trudged along, laden with equipment and battle armor, up a 1,000-foot vertical rise. Some soldiers gulped their entire water supplies within a half-hour. Fisher paced himself.</p>
            <p>But about halfway up, Pvt. Robert Bonner collapsed.</p>
            <p>Bonner, fresh out of basic training, gathered himself and wobbled along for another 20 yards up the ravine &mdash; and then buckled again. Ashen-</p>
            <p>faced, he lay on his back, glasses fogging, searching for something &mdash; anything &mdash; to get him up the hill.</p>
            <p>Getting no sympathy from Armstrong, Bonner rose to his feet and tried again. He collapsed. Other members of the platoon hurled mocking epithets as motivation. Armstrong conferred with other sergeants about whether to evacuate the struggling private from the drill or push him harder.</p>
            <p>They decided to push. Fisher felt for the newcomer &mdash; but only a little.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;If I was in Iraq,&rdquo; he said, crouching on one knee in the ravine, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d beat his ass myself. &hellip; You gotta make yourself capable.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Fisher rose and turned to power his way up the mountain. Bonner struggled to his feet and eventually made it to the ridgeline. The Army designed the desert exercise to push soldiers to their limits, past pain and discomfort.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; Bonner asked.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Motrin &mdash; let me see that,&rdquo; Fisher interrupted.</p>
            <p>Bonner tossed him the bottle. He crammed six pills into his mouth and gulped some water from his camelback.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how you take pills,&rdquo; Fisher said, smiling. </p>
            <p>The troops loaded into their vehicles and moved toward a steep mountainside, where they found a white truck abandoned at the base. Inside the vehicle, they discovered two shovels, a GPS device and ammunition.</p>
            <p>Armstrong gathered Fisher and the rest of his squad and began the climb up the slope. Soon, they came across a mortar pit and continued their search along the ridgeline. In fading light, Fisher hailed the others in his unit.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;How do you say, ‘Hands up&rsquo;?&rdquo; he hollered, looking for the Arabic translation. Then he repeated the question and pointed to a spot on the mountainside. &ldquo;Right there &mdash; behind that bush!&rdquo;</p>
            <p>A bearded man emerged.</p>
            <p>The play-actor in this scenario identified himself as a resident of the nearby village. He explained that he had been helping a friend, who had been discovered nearby, recover a delivery truck stolen by insurgents. The two men tried &mdash; unsuccessfully &mdash; to talk the soldiers into releasing them.</p>
            <p>The squad scrambled down the mountain in darkness, using night-vision goggles that illuminated their path but distorted their depth perception. Almost to the bottom, Fisher stumbled and fell hard, twisting his right ankle &mdash; the same one he had hurt on the training run at Fort Carson.</p>
            <p>He limped back to his vehicle.</p>
            <p>By the time the prisoners had been transported and processed, it was 4 a.m. on May 4, 2008 &mdash; Fisher&rsquo;s 19th birthday. After two hours of sleep, he sat on his bed wrapping his foot and ankle with a bandage.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think I&rsquo;m made of glass,&rdquo; he said.</p>
            <p>Later, he came across Weisensel complimenting Armstrong for the job the unit had done the night before. Both men they had taken into custody turned out to be &ldquo;high-value targets&rdquo; in the exercise.</p>
            <p>Weisensel turned toward him.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Good eyes, Fisher,&rdquo; he said.</p>
            <p>But the boost for his good work in the field later gave way to disappointment. The company medic wanted Fisher to get another opinion on his injured ankle. Now, Fisher returned with crutches and another prescription for Vicodin.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What a great birthday present,&rdquo; he moaned.</p>

            <p>Her name was Kirsten.</h6>
            <p>The breakup with Kayla had gone badly. She&rsquo;d found someone new, he&rsquo;d fired off an angry message through MySpace, and there followed a flurry of recriminations over a restraining order. Meanwhile, Kirsten saw Ian&rsquo;s name on MySpace and wondered whether it was the same person she had dated briefly in high school. She sent a message that triggered further communication via phone and text.</p>
            <p>Next thing she knew, Ian asked her to marry him. Kirsten thought he was joking. But the two of them talked about it, and she figured, why not? When he showed up at her house the following weekend, it was the first time she had seen him in two or three years.</p>
            <p>He wanted to get married before heading to Iraq. Kirsten felt that while they could still be engaged, maybe they should just consider themselves boyfriend and girlfriend &mdash; though she&rsquo;d still wear the ring.</p>
            <p>As they sat on his bed discussing the possibilities, conversation only seemed to confuse the issue.</p>
            <p>Kirsten wasn&rsquo;t sure she was ready to get married and hadn&rsquo;t broadcast news of her engagement. Ian wanted to get legally married soon &mdash; July 4, only two weeks away, would be patriotic and an easy anniversary date to remember.</p>
            <p>They quarreled without resolution.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Ian prepared to do something special for another woman &mdash; his mom.</p>

            <p>On the last day of his leave, a Sunday, Ian gave Teri Mercill what she had described as the greatest gift she could ask for. He accompanied her to Wellshire Presbyterian Church in Denver, where he was baptized on her birthday.</p>
            <p>Ian pronounced it a &ldquo;pretty interesting experience.&rdquo; He attracted the attention and admiration of a welcoming congregation, whose members would seek to maintain their connection by sending him prayers and &ldquo;care packages&rdquo; during his Iraq deployment.</p>
            <p>Ian considered himself a religious person but said that baptism meant nothing to him spiritually. Still, he felt pleased that even going through the motions made such a difference to his mother.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It has given me a lot stronger sense of peace letting him go on deployment,&rdquo; Teri said. &ldquo;I just feel like he has that little extra in his pocket to watch over him. &hellip; He might have started out doing it for me, but I think he ended up doing it for himself.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>After church, they had brunch at a nearby restaurant, where the celebration offered no hint of the trouble to come. Little more than a week later, Ian set in motion a sequence of events that, powered by anger, uncertainty and what he would later admit was his own immaturity, would threaten to destroy his military career.</p>

David Donoso on July 24, 2008. Fisher returned late from the weekend again, then turned himself in for having a drug problem, which lets him avoid any penalty for previous drug use. In the days to follow, Fisher&rsquo;s continued failure to cooperate put him in danger of getting kicked out. Instead, after a conference call with Fisher&rsquo;s dad, the battalion commander gave him another chance, assigning him to a new platoon and dropping him in rank. <span class="photog">Craig F.

    <div class="row">
        <div class="large-8 large-centered medium-9 medium-centered small-12 small-centered columns">
             <p class="lead">While home for a weekend in July, partying with friends, Fisher discovered on Sunday night that his car wouldn&rsquo;t start. He telephoned his superiors and got clearance to return once he had gotten it repaired Monday morning.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="large-6 large-centered medium-6 medium-centered small-11 small-centered columns">
            <p>The car was fixed by 9 a.m. But Fisher didn&rsquo;t immediately head back to Fort Carson &mdash; an issue that came to light when a suspicious squad leader called the mechanic to check. When Fisher finally did return, he had a confession to make: He had a drug problem.</p>
            <p>As far as platoon sergeant Weisensel was concerned, Fisher had officially become a &ldquo;problem child.&rdquo; There&rsquo;d been the weekend hiccup with Duenez. He&rsquo;d failed three straight physical training tests. Injuries seemed to find him in field training. He&rsquo;d misled them about his car.</p>
            <p>And now, Fisher admitted that he had abused cocaine.</p>
            <p>Weisensel wasn&rsquo;t surprised. The frequent weekends at home and the constant hanging out with friends had made it clear that Fisher was a soldier who still had a foot in two worlds.</p>
            <p>But Weisensel also saw an ulterior motive. By self-reporting a drug issue, Fisher guaranteed that he would be admitted to the Army Substance Abuse Program &mdash; and, most significantly, dodge any penalty for his past abuse.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s basically a one-time ‘get out of jail free card&rsquo; for everybody that does drugs,&rdquo; Weisensel said. &ldquo;If it was up to me, he&rsquo;d be gone.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Fisher&rsquo;s frustration mounted. He wanted out of 3rd Platoon &mdash; too much friction with superiors &mdash; but he wanted to stay in the Army. He admitted his trouble was mostly his own fault. Some of it stemmed from recreational drug use, some of it from simmering anger. Kirsten told him he scared her when he got mad and wanted her old Ian back.</p>
            <p>But the Army didn&rsquo;t figure to be so forgiving.</p>
            <p>At the end of July, Fisher left his platoon, telling a superior in a text message that he needed time to think. His career seemed headed for an abrupt end, even though he had shown flashes of potential. Capt. William &ldquo;David&rdquo; Whaley, the new company commander, noted that when he applied himself, Fisher could be an &ldquo;average to above-average soldier.&rdquo; In fact, the captain noted, he had done well at the National Training Center and fell into trouble only with &ldquo;off-post&rdquo; actions.</p>
            <p>Weisensel saw an internal conflict.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I have seen him perform,&rdquo; the sergeant said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a bad kid &mdash; a young man &mdash; but he definitely has some issues he needs to resolve within himself to be successful in the military.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Earlier, he had described young men like Fisher as &ldquo;not uncommon&rdquo; in today&rsquo;s Army. Recruits usually signed up for a handful of reasons, he said: for the money, for lack of options, or because they&rsquo;d just become &ldquo;sick of being nothing at home.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Most were kids trying to do a grown man&rsquo;s job. They did juvenile things and, in the military culture, suffered the consequences. They needed to grow up and &ldquo;find their path&rdquo; &mdash; both in life and in the Army, he figured.</p>
            <p>That hadn&rsquo;t happened yet for Ian Fisher.</p>
            <p>He refused to train with his platoon, missing out on some of the key preparations for the upcoming deployment to Iraq. The paperwork on his transgressions piled up as he marched &mdash; inexorably, it seemed &mdash; toward sanctions that, among other things, would bust him in rank and pay.</p>
            <p>He felt certain his platoon leaders wanted him out of the Army.</p>
            <p>But he had sunk so low he didn&rsquo;t think he cared anymore, despite what friends and family told him about the devastating impact of such a discharge on his future.</p>
            <p>Finally, Lt. Col. Doug Cardinale, commander of the battalion, called Fisher into his office, where, with other officers present, he began to officially impose sanctions.</p>
            <p>When he asked Fisher why he had behaved this way, the private nearly broke down &mdash; but insisted that he wanted out of the military. Cardinale wasn&rsquo;t so sure.</p>
            <p>While Fisher waited outside, Cardinale called his father and discussed solutions. </p>
            <p>The commander agreed to transfer Fisher to a new platoon &mdash; but the move came at a price. Punishment included 45 days of extra duty, 45 days of restriction and a loss of pay. He also got busted in rank from an E3, where he had entered the Army from high school, to an E1.</p>
            <p>But it was a fresh start.</p>

            <p>Soon afterward, Fisher took his physical training test. Within minutes of learning his score, he phoned his dad to tell him he had passed for the first time in months.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Right now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting a new start in a different platoon and I am basically getting to show them who I really can be.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Still, he had to hop on the fast track to ready himself for deployment in September. His new unit embraced him as he moved through an accelerated preparation process. He worked around his extra-duty punishment.</p>
            <p>Eric Fisher and Teri Mercill drove down to Fort Carson with their son to say goodbye before the troops flew out two days later. They spent a good part of the day on the base, having lunch and shopping, anticipating a difficult farewell.</p>
            <p>In an odd way, Eric felt more comfortable with Ian&rsquo;s deployment to Iraq than he did having him home. The last flurry of problems reminded him that as long as his son clung to his past, he would have trouble moving forward.</p>
            <p>Teri wrestled with every mother&rsquo;s concerns &mdash; the well-being of a son heading into harm&rsquo;s way. But on one level, she also saw how Ian had struggled to shake free of a teen culture in which many of his friends floated, directionless, in a kind of limbo. She saw him as accepting of the Army&rsquo;s discipline, yet wistful about the freedoms of civilian life.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, Teri got into Ian&rsquo;s car and prepared to drive it back home for storage. She beeped the horn, looked back and waved in time to see one of Ian&rsquo;s buddies throw a consoling arm around her son.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s crying,&rdquo; she sighed &mdash; and then began crying herself.</p>
            <p>Two days later, Ian Fisher awoke in the wee hours. He checked out his SAW, whose serial number he now knew by heart. He juggled belongings from his duffel bag to his carry-on. With the rest of the unit, he shuttled from point to point on the base until finally boarding a bus to the airport.</p>
            <p>He was stoic now, focused on the airplane that would take him toward his first combat deployment &mdash; and add another generation to the family&rsquo;s military legacy.</p>
            <p>There had come a moment two days earlier when he and his father had finally been alone, walking through the PX. They had draped an arm around each other. Eric told Ian how much he loved him, how much he would miss him. He reminded his son to be alert, take care of himself and make him proud. Then he told Ian what to do if he ever found himself in a situation where it looked like all was lost.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Keep pulling that trigger,&rdquo; Eric had said, &ldquo;until you can&rsquo;t pull it any more. Go out in a blaze of glory.&rdquo;</p>
