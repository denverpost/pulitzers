									<h4>Molina Speaks is a poet, writer, performer, recording artist and professional educator. He lives &ldquo;on a spaceship that carries massive bodies of water and 7 billion people around the cosmos,&rdquo; though sleeps most nights in West Denver. </h4>
									<p class="lead">Q. Is your writing impacted by current events? Things like wars or social strife or natural disasters or even politics?</p>
									<p>My writing is a balance between what I see happening before my eyes and what I envision in my mind, heart, and soul. Ignoring current events makes you irrelevant, but focusing too much on them takes away from the artistic process of shaping and creating alternate realities. </p>
									<p class="lead">Q. In what ways do you think your work is relevant to the times we live in?</p>
									<p>Poetry is the living word. It is documentation of reality, as well as abstractions that invite fantasy. I believe the most compelling work is genuinely timely and in this way is timeless because cycles repeat and reality spirals. It is the job of the poet to communicate this in some fashion.</p>

									<p class="lead">Q. Do you see poetry as a record of the present? </p>
									<p>Poetry is absolutely a record of the present, ever shifting and changing. I have been working for years on a process of Live Poetic Scribing, which weaves together focused listening and interpretation skills and cultural and artistic discernment, then turning real-time events over to the people in poetic form.</p>
									<p class="lead">Q. Here, on this website, we give people a lot of bad news. And there are pressing issues. Violence, racism, the environment, poverty and this bubbling sense that we&rdquo;re not all getting along. Do you think poetry can be a tool for helping us cope? </p>
									<p>I do feel that a lot is unraveling, the current systems, meanings, symbols of understanding, cultures, ways of being&hellip; everything is changing rapidly. Playing with the living word is a form of art. All art is medicine for the soul.</p>

									<h4>Serena Chopra is a multi-talented poet, professor, copywriter and editor living in Denver. She&rsquo;s also dancer with Evolving Doors Dance company And she&rsquo;s an accomplished visual artist who completed a two-year residency at RedLine studios.</h4>
									<p class="lead">Q. In what ways do you think your poetry is relevant to the times we live in?</p>
									<p>It is relevant to time. I am immediate and reactive, so my work is hot off what is burning me deep down, which is always many timely things and histories. &ldquo;Ic,&rdquo; the long poem I read from here, is a 130-page rant on the effects of institutionalized diversity initiatives on marginalized communities. I write quickly, so whatever is in my radius during those weeks of composition, gets consumed by the work. A lot gets edited out, of course, but everything is cosmic in relevance. Or relevance is cosmic. Meaning, what gets in is, of course, relevant because it was on time and in the way or along a path just standing there, relevantly. And if my poem is in your way today, it&rsquo;s probably on time and relevant to you, cosmically speaking.</p>
									<p class="lead">Q. Is your writing impacted by current events? Wars or social strife or tragic natural disasters or even politics?</p>
									<p>My everything is impacted by all these things always.</p>
									<p class="lead">Q. Do you see poetry as a record of the present?</p> 
									<p>I think that language is the center of everything and the circumference of nothing so poetry has this great ability to be an eternally recording present.

									<p class="lead">Q.Here, on this website, we give people a lot of bad news. Violence, racism, the environment, poverty and this bubbling sense that we&rsquo;re all not getting along. Do you think poetry can be a tool for helping us cope?</p>
									<p>These things have, many, many, many times, shut me down &mdash; to my art, to life. I have awful anxiety when I feel helpless. I think that writing has often helped me to find my way through this anxiety and allowed me to find productive and critical ways of encountering &ldquo;the news.&rdquo; Writing and reading poetry has certainly given me a way to converse with pressing issues, and a way to speak. It has also guided me toward action and has opened major nodes in my teaching practice, which I think is a significant and potent avenue for coping, conversation and activism. So, yeah, poetry is an essential tool &mdash; one that I think is not applied enough. It gives us the ability to see in different ways, to find new ways of thinking, of healing, of coping, of change.</p>

									<h4>Joseph Braun is a poet who lives in Boulder. He is a co-founder of LuNaMoPoLiS, a publishing space that looks at poetry as correspondence and he is editor of &ldquo;The Lune,&rdquo; a monthly journal of poetry, distributed unbound in an envelope. </h4>
									<p class="lead">Q. In what ways do you think your poetry is relevant to the times we live in?</p>
									<p>Ah, time is with us and time escapes us! As a child I went fishing with my father a lot. When you feel pressed for time, you may as well not go fishing &mdash; you can&lsquo;t (or won&rsquo;t) explore the water as fully as necessary (to catch a fish, at least). I feel like my poetry is relevant when it resonates with that willful patience, the kind that says &ldquo;If we really look at this place, something meaningful will emerge.&rdquo; Also, my poems grow shorter and shorter, and that feels appropriate in this age of endless information.</p>
									<p class="lead">Q. Is your writing impacted by current events? Wars or social strife or tragic natural disasters or even politics?</p>
									<p>Impacted, absolutely. But I am the sort of person who feels strongly about the relative motion of planets, what those far-off movements suggest about our innermost developments. I had a landlord who was dedicated to saving the elephants but simply could not treat her tenants with respect. Preserving life is an obvious and dire concern. But what does it mean when a Tibetan monk self-immolates?</p>

									<p class="lead">Q. Do you see poetry as a record of the present? </p> 
									<p>In a wonderful essay called &ldquo; Write Till You Drop, &rdquo; Annie Dillard mentions the fact that Walt Whitman rarely left his room. This was a man for whom the poem was a microcosm of the world and all its customs and cultures. Can sitting in your room be more than a personal act? Of course, and the internet gives us good proof. But even &mdash; and perhaps especially &mdash; without the internet, taking stock of this moment in time is a tremendously powerful thing to do.</p>
									<p class="lead">Q. Here, on this website, we give people a lot of bad news. Do you think poetry can help us cope? </p> 
									<p>Poetry helps us remember we&lsquo;re breathing, that the heart is a musical function, and that our names are unique tones in the soundscape of humanity. I tend to feel that poetry teaches us how to move beyond coping, to experience breakthrough&hellip;when language is a thing made not to contain meaning but to release it (re: Frank O&rsquo;Hara, &ldquo;you just go on your nerve&rdquo;). Poetry is like sweat, this beautiful evidence of the body struggling to balance itself out.</p>

									<h4>Sommer Browning is a poet and artist who has published both her writing and her uniquely conceptual drawings. She reads frequently around the region, lives in Denver&rsquo;s La Alma-Lincoln Park neighborhood and works as a librarian at the Auraria Library downtown.</h4>
									<p class="lead">Q. Here, on this website, we give people a lot of bad news. Do you think poetry can be a tool for helping us cope?</p>
									<p>I think all art aims to engender empathy, to deepen the connection between humans that most likely will never meet. This is one of the most humbling and inspirational things a poem of mine can do. When someone tells me they connect with a poem, that it made them feel or think or reel or dream, I am floored and honored and grateful. I think this is tied to why I write, why I would even consider sitting down and taking time out of my life to do something that so many people don&rsquo;t.</p>
									<p class="lead">Q. Do you see poetry as a record of the present?</p>
									<p>Perhaps poetry records one tiny piece of the present, a kind of thread of human thought or consciousness, but alone it would only be a very small, distorted piece of the story. That is why we need all modes of communication, all voices, all human histories and stories, so together they can bear witness to the present. </p>

									<p class="lead">Q. In what ways do you think your poetry is relevant to the times we live in?</p>
									<p>I like thinking about this question. I like how art must speak to what is timelessly human &mdash; love, fear, curiosity &mdash; but it also must be filtered through the time in which it was written and read. In a practical way, it just shouldn &rsquo;t work. Like a computer in the middle ages or an abacus in the hands of a 55-year-old CPA in 2015. But it does work, it isn&rsquo;t technology or a tool, it isn &rsquo;t outside us like that, so maybe that is why it can &rsquo;t really break or expire. I write through my white, American, mother, 21st century lens about love, fear, and curiosity and so this is why it might reflect our times (but relevancy is in the eye of the beholder!).</p>
									<p class="lead">Q. Is your writing impacted by current events?</p>
									<p>These things impact the way I love my child, the way I spend my money, the way I eat, the way I make money, the way I interact with the grocery store clerk, everything. And they impact my poems, as well.</p>

									<h4>Denver Poet Noah Eli Gordon is an assistant professor in the MFA program in Creative Writing at the University of Colorado where he directs Subito Press.</h4>
									<p class="lead">Q. In what ways do you think your poetry is relevant to the times we live in?</p>
									<p>Whether written two thousand years ago or just last Wednesday, I think all poetry speaks to us from the present, from a multiplicity of presences, from a place that tells us not necessarily what life was like at any historical moment but rather, and more poignantly, what it was &mdash; and is &mdash; like to be alive.</p>
									<p class="lead">Q. Is your writing impacted by current events?</p>
									<p>Just as my life is impacted by current events and cultural and political economies, my body impacted, my agency and autonomy impacted, so too is my writing. Even if it conceals and curdles such an impact, such spinning and changes forces into (being), for example, a poem meditating on the morning sunrise. The shades and colors of anything inherently beautiful always carries an echo, a trace of whatever blood might have been spilled the night before in another city by someone else. Poetry is often born of the inextricable bond between atrocity and grace.</p>

									<p> I see poetry not as a record of the present as much as it is an enactment of the present, a means though which time stands still, becomes a kind of tactile thing one can walk around and view from all angles as it unfolds, tumbling down the page or echoing in the air.</p>
									<p class="lead">Q. Here, on this website, we give people a lot of bad news. Do you think poetry can be a tool for helping us cope with all that?</p>
									<p>Poetry won&rsquo;t untangle the mess of our lives, but it may, if we&rsquo;re lucky, make of that entanglement an art as simple as glass of water on the windowsill, as complex as the neurons now firing in the brain of the child reaching slowly for it in thirst.</p>

									<p class="lead"> Q. Here, on this website, we give people a lot of bad news, at least that&rsquo;s what they click on. And there are pressing issues. Violence, racism, the environment, poverty and this bubbling sense that we&rsquo;re all not getting along. With all of this comes inevitable moments of worry, that things are changing &mdash; the culture, the climate, our common sense of civility. And I wonder if you think poetry can be a tool for helping us cope with all that?</p>
									<p>Yes! Poetry thinks differently than narrative, and in that way it gives us the opportunity to reflect; it doesn&rsquo;t have that narrative linearity that assumes beginning/middle/ending. So we are invited to sink into poetry as a site of many processes: elegy, renewal, defiance, hilarity, even disorientation. And the rhythms and textures of poetic language also add real pleasure, even to difficult subject matter.</p>
									<p class="lead">Q. Is your writing impacted by current events in the greater culture?</p>
									<p>I am leery of writing overtly political poetry because so often politicized poetry tries to impose its own agenda and that makes it dull. That said, I have been writing about my experiences with the homeless people with whom I work, but I hope that what comes forward first is my interest in and engagement with these people whom I enjoy so much. In any case, nothing is ever off-limits in poetry (or other arts) as far as I am concerned.</p>

									<p>I don&rsquo;t try to be topical, but I think that art-making of any kind is the result of curiosity, and so I think my writing reflects interest in, and responsiveness, to the world around me. My formal decisions (phrasing, use of the page, images) are permissions (or maybe limitations) that are inevitably affected by the contemporary poetry I read, but also my love of modernist writing from the last century.</p>

									<p class="lead">Q. Is your writing impacted by current events in the greater culture? Things like wars or social strife or natural disasters or even politics?</p>
									<p>Sometimes, yes, but not very often. When I was 14 I wrote a poem called &ldquo;Aimerica.&rdquo; My attempt to dismember the Bush Administration that I knew little to nothing about. It was terrible. I had a line in there &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something crude about your oil.&rdquo; Terrible. Ever since then I don&rsquo;t get very political, unless it&rsquo;s also personal.</p>

									<p>Any time I&rsquo;ve tried to write a &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; poem, it&rsquo;s failed miserably. I feel like the poems I write that end up being the most relevant are the ones I don&rsquo;t really have a choice but to write. The ones that have their own sense of urgency. So if my poems ever are relevant it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s based on some catalyst of my time, and I&rsquo;m lucky if it strikes a chord with someone out there.</p>

									<p class="lead">Q. Here, on this website, we give people a lot of bad news, at least that&rsquo;s what they click on. And there are pressing issues. Violence, racism, the environment, poverty and this bubbling sense that we&rsquo;re all not getting along. With all of this comes inevitable moments of worry, that things are changing &mdash; the culture, the climate, our common sense of civility. And I wonder if you think poetry can be a tool for helping us cope with all that?</p>
									<p>Absolutely. I know it&rsquo;s affected me in that way many times. Andrea Gibson&rsquo;s poetry comes to mind. She reminds me that you are allowed to feel the things you feel and that you are far from alone, and then she holds you accountable for your part in fixing that bubbling sense that we&rsquo;re all not getting along.</p>
