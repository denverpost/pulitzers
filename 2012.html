I was like, &lsquo;Do I really want to take the bus to work every day for $10 an hour and live in a crappy apartment?&rsquo; I was going to end up in jail or doing drugs. So instead of going to work one day, I just took the bus to the recruiting station.&rdquo; Scott said he was not aware of the looming war in Iraq when he signed up. &ldquo;I was 18 years old.

                <p>A photo essay of a combat veteran&rsquo;s grueling readjustment to life in Colorado following two tours of duty in Iraq earned Denver Post photographer Craig F. Walker a Pulitzer Prize on Monday.</p>
                <p>It is the second time in three years Walker has earned the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography. The Pulitzers are considered journalism&rsquo;s highest honors, and Walker appears to be only the fourth entrant in the contest&rsquo;s photography categories ever to win a Pulitzer twice for solo work.</p>

                        <p>Craig F. Walker was a photojournalist for <em>The Denver Post</em> from 1998-2015.</p>
                        <p>After growing up in York, Pennsylvania, Walker attended the Rhode Island School of Photography, graduating in 1986. He worked for <em>Marlboro Enterprise</em> and the <em>Berkshire Eagle</em> prior to taking a position with <em>The Denver Post</em> in 1998. He has covered national and international stories.
                            <p>In 2004, he won first place from the National Press Photographers Association for a photographic series on child camel jockeys in Kuwait.</p>
                            <p>In 2010, Walker won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography &ldquo;for his intimate portrait of a teenager who joins the Army at the height of insurgent violence in Iraq, poignantly searching for meaning and manhood.&rdquo; In 2012 he won again the same prize in the category &ldquo;Feature Photography&rdquo; for his photodocumentary &ldquo;Welcome Home.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Today, he is on staff of the <em>Boston Globe</em>.</p>

                <p>Walker&rsquo;s first Pulitzer, in 2010, was for &ldquo;Ian Fisher: American Soldier,&rdquo; which documented a young man&rsquo;s progression from the life of a high school student to becoming a soldier in Iraq.</p>
                <p>This year&rsquo;s prize was for Walker&rsquo;s gripping photographs of reconnaissance man Scott Ostrom, a 27-year-old combat veteran suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty amazing and very humbling,&rdquo; Walker said of winning two Pulitzers. &ldquo;It is shocking and unbelievable and just hard to grasp.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The Pulitzer judges wrote that Walker&rsquo;s photos, appearing in an online series called &ldquo;Welcome Home,&rdquo; compassionately chronicled Ostrom&rsquo;s life and &ldquo;enabled viewers to better grasp a national issue.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>In other categories, the Pulitzer judges recognized the Philadelphia Inquirer for public service in its reporting on violence in schools. </p>
                <p>In investigative reporting, The Associated Press won for its stories chronicling the New York Police Department&rsquo;s systematic spying on Muslims. That award was shared with reporters from The Seattle Times, who wrote about a government body that moved patients off a safer pain medication to methadone, prompting statewide health warnings.</p>
                <p>Twenty-four-year-old Sara Ganim and The Patriot-News staff in Harrisburg, Penn., won for local reporting of the Penn State sex-abuse scandal involving former football coach Jerry Sandusky.</p>
                <p>Walker said he grew up at a time when America was largely at peace, and he was fascinated by what engaging in war has meant for the country after Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
                <p>After Walker&rsquo;s 2010 win, he set his sights on finding a veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder who would allow readers into his or her life.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand, so these two people (Fisher and Ostrom) have helped me understand,&rdquo; Walker said. &ldquo;Our nation is going to be seeing a lot of people like Scott for some time.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Walker met Ostrom on a hike for veterans returning from war and asked if he would allow him to photograph him. Walker followed Ostrom for 10 months.</p>
                <p>Ostrom said he wasn&rsquo;t always a willing subject.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I was ambivalent,&rdquo; Ostrom said. &ldquo;When a journalist starts following you around, you know you have PTSD.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Ostrom appeared at Walker&rsquo;s side in The Post newsroom Monday afternoon when the Pulitzer was announced. </p>
                <p>&ldquo;Craig did the story justice,&rdquo; Ostrom said. &ldquo;He kept with it and helped me realize it was important.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Since Walker&rsquo;s photo series was published, veterans have reached out to Ostrom, thanking him for exposing the problem and helping people understand what life is like after experiencing combat.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Your consciousness &mdash; everything that keeps you alive &mdash; is related to violence and aggression. You don&rsquo;t understand societal norms,&rdquo; he said of the disorder. </p>
                <p>Ostrom, who said he will have PTSD for the rest of his life, attends weekly therapy sessions and copes by helping other vets.</p>
                <p>Denver Post editor Gregory L. Moore praised Walker&rsquo;s work and said the photographer&rsquo;s strength comes from patience.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;He captures so many right moments,&rdquo; Moore said, adding that Walker&rsquo;s excellent coverage of soldiers shows that the war is a local story.</p>
                <p>Also for &ldquo;Welcome Home,&rdquo; Walker this year was named Newspaper Photographer of the Year in the Missouri School of Journalism&rsquo;s Pictures of the Year International competition and the American Society of News Editors&rsquo; community-service photojournalism award.</p>

                <p>Walker, a native of York, Pa., graduated from the Rhode Island School of Photography. </p>
                <p>He began his career in Massachusetts at the Marlborough Enterprise. Walker has been with The Post since 1998.</p>
                <p>Walker said he has had the best year of his life. He married photographer Jamie Cotten Walker last summer, and the two have a son, Quinn.</p>
                <p>Walker&rsquo;s photo essay was published online Dec. 30.</p>
                <p>The Pulitzer judges noted that &ldquo;digital content played a role&rdquo; in many winning entries, including public service, breaking-news reporting, investigative reporting, national reporting, editorial cartooning and breaking-news photography. The Huffington Post and Politico &mdash; online-only publications &mdash; were recognized this year.</p>
                <p>Walker&rsquo;s win marks the third consecutive Pulitzer for The Post and the eighth in the paper&rsquo;s history. Editorial cartoonist Mike Keefe, who recently retired, won the prize last year.</p>
