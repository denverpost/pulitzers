That wasn&rsquo;t my plan. It&rsquo;s an honor to die for my country, but I made it home.&rdquo; Scott said that being diagnosed with PTSD &ldquo;means I have nightmares every night. It means I&rsquo;m hyper-vigilant &mdash; It means I have no fuse and if I get attacked, I&rsquo;m going to kill. &hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to feel this way.&rdquo; <span class="photog">Photo by Craig F.

I was like, &lsquo;Do I really want to take the bus to work every day for $10 an hour and live in a crappy apartment?&rsquo; I was going to end up in jail or doing drugs. So instead of going to work one day, I just took the bus to the recruiting station.&rdquo; Scott said he was not aware of the looming war in Iraq when he signed up. &ldquo;I was 18 years old.

			<p>A photo essay of a combat veteran&rsquo;s grueling readjustment to life in Colorado following two tours of duty in Iraq earned Denver Post photographer Craig F. Walker a Pulitzer Prize on Monday.</p>
			<p>It is the second time in three years Walker has earned the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography. The Pulitzers are considered journalism&rsquo;s highest honors, and Walker appears to be only the fourth entrant in the contest&rsquo;s photography categories ever to win a Pulitzer twice for solo work.</p>

                <p class="byline"></p>
				<p>Craig F. Walker was a photojournalist for <em>The Denver Post</em> from 1998-2015.</p>
				<p>After growing up in York, Pennsylvania, Walker attended the Rhode Island School of Photography, graduating in 1986. He worked for <em>Marlboro Enterprise</em> and the <em>Berkshire Eagle</em> prior to taking a position with <em>The Denver Post</em> in 1998. He has covered national and international stories.</p> 
				<p>In 2004, he won first place from the National Press Photographers Association for a photographic series on child camel jockeys in Kuwait.</p>
				<p>In 2010, Walker won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography &ldquo;for his intimate portrait of a teenager who joins the Army at the height of insurgent violence in Iraq, poignantly searching for meaning and manhood.&rdquo; In 2012 he won again the same prize in the category &ldquo;Feature Photography&rdquo; for his photodocumentary &ldquo;Welcome Home.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>Today, he is on staff of the <em>Boston Globe</em>.</p>

			<p>Walker&rsquo;s first Pulitzer, in 2010, was for &ldquo;Ian Fisher: American Soldier,&rdquo; which documented a young man&rsquo;s progression from the life of a high school student to becoming a soldier in Iraq.</p>
			<p>This year&rsquo;s prize was for Walker&rsquo;s gripping photographs of reconnaissance man Scott Ostrom, a 27-year-old combat veteran suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty amazing and very humbling,&rdquo; Walker said of winning two Pulitzers. &ldquo;It is shocking and unbelievable and just hard to grasp.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>The Pulitzer judges wrote that Walker&rsquo;s photos, appearing in an online series called &ldquo;Welcome Home,&rdquo; compassionately chronicled Ostrom&rsquo;s life and &ldquo;enabled viewers to better grasp a national issue.&rdquo;</p>

			<p>In other categories, the Pulitzer judges recognized the Philadelphia Inquirer for public service in its reporting on violence in schools. </p> 
			<p>In investigative reporting, The Associated Press won for its stories chronicling the New York Police Department&rsquo;s systematic spying on Muslims. That award was shared with reporters from The Seattle Times, who wrote about a government body that moved patients off a safer pain medication to methadone, prompting statewide health warnings.</p> 
			<p>Twenty-four-year-old Sara Ganim and The Patriot-News staff in Harrisburg, Penn., won for local reporting of the Penn State sex-abuse scandal involving former football coach Jerry Sandusky.</p> 
			<p>Walker said he grew up at a time when America was largely at peace, and he was fascinated by what engaging in war has meant for the country after Sept. 11, 2001.</p> 
			<p>After Walker&rsquo;s 2010 win, he set his sights on finding a veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder who would allow readers into his or her life.</p> 
			<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t understand, so these two people (Fisher and Ostrom) have helped me understand,&rdquo; Walker said. &ldquo;Our nation is going to be seeing a lot of people like Scott for some time.&rdquo;</p> 
			<p>Walker met Ostrom on a hike for veterans returning from war and asked if he would allow him to photograph him. Walker followed Ostrom for 10 months.</p> 
			<p>Ostrom said he wasn&rsquo;t always a willing subject.</p> 
			<p>&ldquo;I was ambivalent,&rdquo; Ostrom said. &ldquo;When a journalist starts following you around, you know you have PTSD.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Ostrom appeared at Walker&rsquo;s side in The Post newsroom Monday afternoon when the Pulitzer was announced.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Craig did the story justice,&rdquo; Ostrom said. &ldquo;He kept with it and helped me realize it was important.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Since Walker&rsquo;s photo series was published, veterans have reached out to Ostrom, thanking him for exposing the problem and helping people understand what life is like after experiencing combat.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Your consciousness &mdash; everything that keeps you alive &mdash; is related to violence and aggression. You don&rsquo;t understand societal norms,&rdquo; he said of the disorder.</p>
			<p>Ostrom, who said he will have PTSD for the rest of his life, attends weekly therapy sessions and copes by helping other vets.</p>
			<p>Denver Post editor Gregory L. Moore praised Walker&rsquo;s work and said the photographer&rsquo;s strength comes from patience.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;He captures so many right moments,&rdquo; Moore said, adding that Walker&rsquo;s excellent coverage of soldiers shows that the war is a local story.</p>
			 <p>Also for &ldquo;Welcome Home,&rdquo; Walker this year was named Newspaper Photographer of the Year in the Missouri School of Journalism&rsquo;s Pictures of the Year International competition and the American Society of News Editors&rsquo; community-service photojournalism award.</p>

					<p class="caption">Brian Scott Ostrom cups his hand over his mouth as he tries to calm a panic attack at his apartment in Boulder on May 2, 2011. Scott says it&rsquo;s been hard to find meaning in his life since 2007, when he was honorably discharged from the United States Marine Corps. After serving four years as a reconnaissance man and deploying twice to Iraq, Scott returned home to the U.S. with a severe case of post-traumatic stress disorder. &ldquo;The most important part of my life already happened. The most devastating. The chance to come home in a box. Nothing is ever going to compare to what I&rsquo;ve done, so I&rsquo;m struggling to be at peace with that,&rdquo; Scott said. He attributes his PTSD to his second deployment to Iraq, where he served seven months in Fallujah with the 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion. &ldquo;It was the most brutal time of my life,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize it because I was living it. It was a part of me.&rdquo; Since his discharge, Scott has struggled with daily life, from finding and keeping employment to maintaining healthy relationships. But most of all, he&rsquo;s struggled to overcome his brutal and haunting memories of Iraq. Nearly five years later, Scott remains conflicted by the war. Though he is proud of his service and cares greatly for his fellow Marines, he still carries guilt for things he did &mdash; and didn&rsquo;t do &mdash; fighting a war he no longer believes in.<span class="photog"></span></p>

The stitches in his neck were from his attempted suicide earlier in the week after the couple had an argument. &ldquo;It spiraled out of control. &hellip; I was so full of rage and resentment. I was mad at myself. I was in flight-or-fight mode. Since I&rsquo;m a Marine, there is no flight mode. It&rsquo;s fight &hellip; it&rsquo;s kill, kill, kill. Well, I&rsquo;m not going to kill (her),&rdquo; he said. Scott said he believes every combat vet struggling with PTSD has a contingency plan. &ldquo;Every one of us has a suicide plan. We all know how to kill, and we all have a plan to kill ourselves.&rdquo; </p>

Scott said many times he should have died overseas, and during the fight with his girlfriend, she agreed. &ldquo;I just grabbed a pair of scissors. &hellip; I just tried jabbing them into my neck, but they were closed, so I just gave myself a nice laceration. So, I grabbed a nice kitchen knife and cut my wrists,&rdquo; Scott said.</p>

The hike was led by Veterans Expeditions, which aims to help struggling veterans adjust to being home, and to balance their lives. Scott said later he appreciated his conversation with Himber, who is a Vietnam veteran. They talked about a friend of Scott&rsquo;s who was killed in Iraq. Scott often thinks about the &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; he served with. &ldquo;I miss quite a few of those guys. They were all good guys, and there is no replacement for them. &hellip; What you share with those people is stronger than most all the other bonds. One thing that&rsquo;s great about having been a Marine is I&rsquo;ve got friends wherever I go.&rdquo;</p>

He said his anxiety was brought on by a conversation with his girlfriend, who moved all of her belongings out earlier that day. Scott said she also took some of his things, including his anti-anxiety and sleep-aid medication. &ldquo;She took all my s&mdash;- &hellip; my meds &hellip; bunch of my military s---. I hold that stuff very dear to my heart,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be able to sleep tonight &mdash; I&rsquo;m not going to get over this panic attack.&rdquo;</p>

Sitting on the bed, he started crying, later comparing the relationship to the stress of combat. &ldquo;Sometimes I get into fights. It&rsquo;s not a talking thing for me. I handle it like a Marine, like it&rsquo;s a combat situation,&rdquo; Scott said. &ldquo;Being diagnosed with PTSD is an interesting thing. &hellip; It means I have nightmares every night. It means I&rsquo;m hyper-vigilant &mdash; means I&rsquo;m weird about noises in the middle of the night and lock my doors. It means I have no fuse and if I get attacked, I&rsquo;m going to kill. &hellip; I don&rsquo;t want to feel this way.&rdquo;</p>

It always is.&rdquo; He decided to go for a walk and take photos. Photography was part of his training as a reconnaissance man in the Marines and, upon his return, it became a hobby. He passed by an older vet wearing a Marine cap. Scott said, &ldquo;You see the older veterans. They just look at you, but you know what they&rsquo;re thinking. I had one guy tell me: &lsquo;Well, I fought in a real war.&rsquo;</p>

It&rsquo;s not, though.&rdquo; He tossed the papers across the table. As Scott got up to leave, the manager apologized and said, &ldquo;Thank you for service.&rdquo; Scott went outside and muttered, &ldquo;Thank you for your service. &hellip; thank you for your f------ service.&rdquo;</p>

I was arrested twice, there&rsquo;s blood all over the bathroom floor, it was small, it was loud.&rdquo; He sat on the floor of his new apartment, relaxed. &ldquo;I make the rules here. I control who visits me. I have room here. I feel like I&rsquo;m getting a fresh start. I don&rsquo;t hear a thing. This is peace and quiet. This is what I need.&rdquo; Scott said his life before Iraq was normal. &ldquo;I was so different. I was a normal high school kid. Then I joined the Marines. &hellip; I learned a lot of lessons really fast. &hellip; But when I got out, I let all that go. I adapted to my new environment. I let my hair grow. I started smoking pot. I adapted. I was adapting well, but now I feel like the black sheep.&rdquo;</p>

My parents were proud of me.&rdquo; He talked about why he signed up. &ldquo;I had just totaled my truck. … I was like, &lsquo;Do I really want to take the bus to work every day for $10 an hour and live in a crappy apartment?&rsquo; I was going to end up in jail or doing drugs. So instead of going to work one day, I just took the bus to the recruiting station.&rdquo; Scott said he was not aware of the looming war in Iraq when he signed up. &ldquo;I was 18 years old. I didn&rsquo;t watch the news. &hellip; I didn&rsquo;t care. I just wanted to do something.&rdquo;</p>

I can&rsquo;t believe I used to maka maka people,&rdquo; a term he uses for killing. Scott doesn&rsquo;t like the side effects of the medications the VA prescribed him. &ldquo;Those medicines weren&rsquo;t addressing the issue itself and honestly didn&rsquo;t work for me. &hellip; I am going to get better. I want to get better. But right now, that is not the case. And what I do in the mean time to help with these problems is I use cannabis –- I sleep better, and I don&rsquo;t have side effects from it.&rdquo;</p>

I fall asleep, but it doesn&rsquo;t make it better. Everybody says, &lsquo;With time, with time it will all go away.&rsquo; So I&rsquo;m waiting.&rdquo; He got up, smoked a cigarette, made coffee and complained about the dirty dishes and his messy apartment. Just as he started cleaning, he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have the motivation to do this s&mdash;-. I don&rsquo;t have any motivation.&rdquo; Scott returned to the spare room, smoked some pot and pulled out his journal from Iraq. While he read, he laughed hard. Then shortly after his burst of laughter, he verged on tears. He put the journal aside and laid back down, Jibby joining him.</p>
